Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is associated with high morbidity, frequent hospitalizations, and increased mortality. Despite guideline-directed medical therapy, many patients remain symptomatic with impaired functional capacity. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes and HFrEF, but evidence for functional outcomes in a broader HFrEF population is limited. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SGLT2i therapy in adults with HFrEF.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 12 cardiology centers between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged ≥40 years with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–III symptoms were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive SGLT2i therapy or matching placebo, in addition to guideline-directed medical therapy, for 52 weeks. The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included NYHA functional class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score, rates of heart failure hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models and Cox proportional hazards models.

Results:
A total of 484 participants were randomized (mean age 66.1 ± 10.3 years; 38% female). At 52 weeks, the SGLT2i group demonstrated a greater improvement in 6MWD compared with placebo (+48.3 ± 30.7 m vs +21.4 ± 28.9 m; adjusted mean difference 26.9 m, 95% CI 20.3–33.5; p < 0.001). NYHA functional class improved in 61.2% of SGLT2i-treated patients versus 40.7% in the placebo group (p < 0.001), and KCCQ overall summary scores increased significantly (+13.8 vs +6.1 points; p < 0.001). Heart failure hospitalizations occurred in 12.4% of the SGLT2i group versus 20.8% in placebo (hazard ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.36–0.85; p = 0.007). All-cause mortality was numerically lower in the SGLT2i group (7.8% vs 10.9%; p = 0.18). Adverse events were similar between groups, with a slightly higher incidence of genital infections in the SGLT2i group (4.5% vs 1.6%) and comparable rates of volume depletion and renal adverse events.

Conclusions:
In adults with HFrEF, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy significantly improved exercise capacity, functional status, quality of life, and reduced heart failure hospitalizations, with an acceptable safety profile. These findings support SGLT2i as an effective therapeutic option in the management of HFrEF.
