Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity, end-stage renal disease, and mortality. Despite current standard-of-care therapies, including renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, disease progression remains a major clinical concern. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have demonstrated renal and cardiovascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes, but their efficacy in CKD patients with and without diabetes requires further evaluation. This study assessed the effectiveness and safety of SGLT2i therapy in adults with CKD.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 15 nephrology centers between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 40–80 years with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25–60 mL/min/1.73 m² and albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] 30–3000 mg/g) were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive an SGLT2 inhibitor or matching placebo in addition to standard therapy for 52 weeks. The primary outcome was change in eGFR slope over 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included progression to end-stage renal disease, changes in UACR, blood pressure, cardiovascular events, and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models and Cox proportional hazards models.

Results:
A total of 648 participants were randomized (mean age 64.7 ± 9.5 years; 52% female; 48% with type 2 diabetes). The SGLT2i group demonstrated a slower decline in eGFR compared with placebo (−1.2 ± 0.6 vs −3.4 ± 0.7 mL/min/1.73 m² per year; adjusted mean difference 2.2 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI 1.9–2.5; p < 0.001). UACR decreased significantly in the SGLT2i group (−28.6% vs −8.3%; p < 0.001). Progression to end-stage renal disease occurred in 4.9% of the SGLT2i group versus 9.6% of placebo (hazard ratio 0.50; 95% CI 0.29–0.85; p = 0.01). Blood pressure decreased modestly (−4.7 mmHg systolic; p < 0.01). Adverse events were comparable between groups, with slightly higher rates of genital infections in the SGLT2i group (4.3% vs 1.6%). No significant differences in volume depletion or acute kidney injury were observed.

Conclusions:
In adults with CKD, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy slowed renal function decline, reduced albuminuria, and decreased progression to end-stage renal disease, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support SGLT2i as an effective therapeutic option for kidney protection in patients with CKD.
