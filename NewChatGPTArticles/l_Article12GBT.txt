Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory disorder associated with high morbidity, frequent exacerbations, and increased healthcare utilization. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a cornerstone of COPD management, improving exercise capacity, symptoms, and quality of life. However, access to center-based PR is limited, and home-based or telehealth interventions are increasingly proposed. This study evaluated the efficacy of a structured home-based, telemonitoring-supported PR program compared with usual care in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.

Methods:
We conducted a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial across six tertiary hospitals from March 2021 to December 2024. Adults aged 40–80 years with GOLD stage II–III COPD and a history of ≥1 exacerbation in the prior year were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a 24-week home-based PR program with remote supervision via telemonitoring (including exercise training, self-management education, and weekly virtual coaching) or usual care. The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, health-related quality of life (St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ), frequency of exacerbations, and adherence. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 312 participants were randomized (mean age 65.4 ± 9.1 years; 54% male). At 24 weeks, the home-based PR group demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in 6MWD compared with usual care (mean increase 52.7 ± 34.1 m vs 14.6 ± 28.9 m; adjusted mean difference 38.1 m, 95% CI 31.2–45.0; p < 0.001). CAT scores decreased more in the intervention group (−6.4 vs −2.1; p < 0.001), and mMRC dyspnea scores improved (−1.2 vs −0.4; p < 0.001). SGRQ total scores improved significantly in the PR group (−12.8 vs −3.6 points; p < 0.001). The rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations was lower in the intervention group (0.32 vs 0.56 per patient-year; p = 0.01). Adherence to the home-based program was high, with 82% of participants completing ≥75% of prescribed sessions. No serious adverse events related to the intervention were reported.

Conclusions:
A structured home-based, telemonitoring-supported pulmonary rehabilitation program significantly improved exercise capacity, symptoms, quality of life, and reduced exacerbation rates in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. These findings support home-based, remotely supervised PR as an effective alternative to center-based programs, expanding access to this essential component of COPD care.
