Migraine is a common, disabling neurologic disorder that substantially impairs quality of life and work productivity. Calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated efficacy for migraine prevention in randomized trials, yet data on their effectiveness, tolerability, and treatment persistence in routine clinical practice remain limited. This study evaluated the real-world effectiveness and safety of a CGRP monoclonal antibody compared with standard oral preventive therapy in adults with episodic and chronic migraine.

Methods:
We conducted a prospective, pragmatic, multicenter cohort study at nine neurology clinics between January 2020 and April 2024. Adults aged 18–65 years with a diagnosis of migraine and at least four monthly migraine days (MMDs) despite prior preventive therapy were eligible. Patients initiating a CGRP monoclonal antibody were compared with patients initiating a guideline-recommended oral preventive medication (beta-blocker, antiepileptic, or tricyclic antidepressant), matched 1:1 using propensity scores. The primary outcome was change in MMDs at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included responder rate (≥50% reduction in MMDs), Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score, acute medication use, treatment persistence, and adverse events. Outcomes were analyzed using mixed-effects models adjusted for baseline characteristics.

Results:
A total of 746 patients were included after matching (mean age 41.8 ± 10.9 years; 73% female; 38% chronic migraine). At 6 months, patients receiving a CGRP monoclonal antibody experienced a greater reduction in MMDs compared with those receiving oral preventive therapy (−6.2 vs −3.1 days; adjusted mean difference −3.1 days, 95% CI −3.7 to −2.4; p < 0.001). The ≥50% responder rate was higher in the CGRP group (54.6% vs 28.9%; p < 0.001). Improvements in MIDAS scores were significantly greater with CGRP therapy (−21.4 vs −11.2 points; p < 0.001), accompanied by a larger reduction in acute medication use. Treatment persistence at 6 months was higher in the CGRP group (82.3% vs 61.5%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were generally mild; constipation and injection-site reactions were more common with CGRP therapy, while fatigue and cognitive complaints were more frequent with oral preventives. Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred less frequently in the CGRP group (6.4% vs 14.8%).

Conclusions:
In routine clinical practice, CGRP monoclonal antibody therapy was associated with greater reductions in monthly migraine days, improved disability, and higher treatment persistence compared with standard oral preventive medications. These findings support the effectiveness and tolerability of CGRP-targeted therapies for migraine prevention in real-world settings.
