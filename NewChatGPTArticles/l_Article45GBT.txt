Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent chronic liver disorder associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and increased cardiovascular risk. Lifestyle interventions remain the cornerstone of therapy, but adherence is often suboptimal. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated metabolic and potential hepatoprotective effects. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RA therapy compared with lifestyle counseling in adults with biopsy-proven NAFLD.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial at eight hepatology centers between February 2021 and October 2024. Adults aged 30–70 years with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive weekly subcutaneous GLP-1 RA therapy or structured lifestyle counseling for 48 weeks. The primary outcome was change in liver fat fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Secondary outcomes included changes in ALT, noninvasive fibrosis markers, body weight, glycemic parameters, and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 238 participants were randomized (mean age 54.2 ± 9.8 years; 56% female; mean BMI 32.7 ± 4.5 kg/m²). At 48 weeks, the GLP-1 RA group demonstrated a greater reduction in liver fat fraction compared with lifestyle counseling (−12.3% ± 6.1% vs −4.8% ± 5.7%; adjusted mean difference −7.5%, 95% CI −8.9 to −6.1; p < 0.001). ALT levels decreased significantly (−34.7 ± 18.2 U/L vs −12.3 ± 15.6 U/L; p < 0.001), and improvements in noninvasive fibrosis scores were observed in the GLP-1 RA group (p = 0.02). Participants receiving GLP-1 RA therapy experienced greater weight loss (−7.8 ± 3.5 kg vs −2.1 ± 2.8 kg; p < 0.001) and improved fasting glucose and HbA1c. Adverse events were primarily mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea 11.3%, diarrhea 7.6%), with no serious drug-related events reported.

Conclusions:
In adults with NAFLD, GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy significantly reduced hepatic fat content, improved liver enzymes, promoted weight loss, and improved glycemic control compared with lifestyle counseling alone. The treatment was well tolerated, supporting GLP-1 RAs as a promising therapeutic option for NAFLD management.
