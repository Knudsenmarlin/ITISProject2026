Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric condition associated with significant functional impairment, reduced quality of life, and increased healthcare utilization. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line pharmacologic therapy, but a substantial proportion of patients fail to achieve adequate symptom remission. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based nonpharmacologic intervention; however, data comparing combined CBT and SSRI therapy versus SSRI monotherapy in routine clinical practice are limited. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of combined CBT and SSRI therapy compared with SSRI monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe MDD.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at eight psychiatric outpatient clinics between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 18–65 years with a DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD, baseline Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) score ≥20, and no CBT within the prior 12 months were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either combined CBT plus SSRI therapy or SSRI monotherapy for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was change in HAM-D17 score from baseline to week 16. Secondary outcomes included response (≥50% reduction in HAM-D17), remission (HAM-D17 ≤7), Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score, quality of life (Short Form-36, SF-36), and treatment-emergent adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 312 participants were randomized (mean age 42.7 ± 11.2 years; 61% female). At week 16, the combined CBT plus SSRI group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in HAM-D17 scores compared with SSRI monotherapy (−15.2 ± 6.8 vs −10.7 ± 6.4; adjusted mean difference −4.5, 95% CI −5.9 to −3.1; p < 0.001). Response rates were higher in the combined therapy group (62.1% vs 41.0%; p < 0.001), as were remission rates (37.8% vs 21.2%; p = 0.002). MADRS and SF-36 mental health subscale scores improved significantly more with combined therapy. Adverse events, primarily mild gastrointestinal symptoms and headache, were similar between groups, with no serious adverse events reported.

Conclusions:
In adults with moderate-to-severe MDD, combined cognitive-behavioral therapy and SSRI treatment resulted in greater improvements in depressive symptoms, response, and remission rates compared with SSRI monotherapy, without increasing adverse events. These findings support integrating CBT into standard pharmacologic treatment to optimize clinical outcomes in MDD.
