Background:
Chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a growing clinical challenge, characterized by impaired diastolic function, exercise intolerance, and high rates of hospitalization. Currently, there are limited pharmacologic therapies that improve outcomes in HFpEF. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown cardiovascular and renal benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but their role in HFpEF remains under investigation. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SGLT2i therapy in adults with HFpEF.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 13 cardiology centers between March 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged ≥50 years with symptomatic HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%), elevated natriuretic peptide levels, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–IV symptoms were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive an SGLT2 inhibitor or matching placebo in addition to standard guideline-directed therapy for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary endpoints included change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score, all-cause mortality, and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using Cox proportional hazards models and mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 654 participants were randomized (mean age 68.9 ± 9.1 years; 56% female). The primary endpoint occurred in 72 patients (22.0%) in the SGLT2i group versus 108 patients (33.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.62; 95% confidence interval 0.46–0.83; p < 0.001). Mean 6MWD improved more in the SGLT2i group (+33.2 ± 21.5 m vs +12.8 ± 19.9 m; p < 0.001), and KCCQ overall summary scores increased (+9.4 vs +3.1 points; p < 0.001). All-cause mortality was numerically lower in the SGLT2i group (7.8% vs 10.5%; p = 0.16). Adverse events were similar between groups, with a slightly higher incidence of genital infections in the SGLT2i group (4.2% vs 1.5%), while rates of volume depletion and renal adverse events were comparable.

Conclusions:
In adults with HFpEF, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization and improved exercise capacity and quality of life, with an acceptable safety profile. These findings support SGLT2 inhibitors as an effective treatment option for HFpEF management.
