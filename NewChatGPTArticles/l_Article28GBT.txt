Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, renal dysfunction, and mortality. Despite standard pharmacologic therapies, many patients fail to achieve optimal glycemic control. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits in patients with T2DM, but data comparing SGLT2i with other glucose-lowering agents in real-world clinical settings are limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of SGLT2i therapy compared with standard oral glucose-lowering therapy in adults with T2DM.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study at eight endocrinology clinics between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 35–75 years with T2DM and baseline HbA1c ≥7.5% who initiated either SGLT2i therapy or standard oral therapy (metformin, sulfonylurea, or DPP-4 inhibitor) were eligible. Patients were propensity score–matched 1:1. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, incidence of cardiovascular events, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Mixed-effects regression models were used to assess treatment effects.

Results:
A total of 1,064 patients were included after matching (mean age 58.9 ± 10.2 years; 51% female). At 12 months, the SGLT2i group achieved a greater reduction in HbA1c compared with standard therapy (−1.2% vs −0.7%; adjusted mean difference −0.5%, 95% CI −0.6 to −0.4; p < 0.001). SGLT2i therapy was associated with significant reductions in body weight (−4.5 kg vs −1.3 kg; p < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (−5.8 mmHg vs −1.9 mmHg; p < 0.001). Incidence of major cardiovascular events was lower in the SGLT2i group (3.9% vs 6.7%; hazard ratio 0.57; 95% CI 0.36–0.90; p = 0.02). Treatment adherence was higher with SGLT2i therapy (85.2% vs 73.5%; p < 0.001). Gastrointestinal events were more frequent with SGLT2i (9.7% vs 3.8%), while hypoglycemia was less common (2.0% vs 5.6%).

Conclusions:
In adults with T2DM, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy resulted in superior glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and lower cardiovascular risk compared with standard oral therapy, with a favorable adherence profile. These findings support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as an effective and safe treatment option in routine clinical practice.
