Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, resulting in substantial functional impairment, decreased quality of life, and high healthcare utilization. Conventional management—including pharmacologic therapy, physical rehabilitation, and lifestyle modification—often provides incomplete relief. Minimally invasive interventions such as epidural steroid injections (ESIs) have been proposed to reduce pain and improve function, yet comparative data on efficacy and long-term outcomes are limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of ESIs combined with optimized conservative therapy (OCT) versus OCT alone in adults with CLBP.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at eight pain management centers between January 2021 and October 2024. Adults aged 25–75 years with CLBP for ≥6 months, an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score ≥30, and no spinal surgery within the prior year were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a single lumbar ESI plus OCT or OCT alone for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity at 24 weeks measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included ODI scores, quality of life (Short Form-36, SF-36), analgesic consumption, patient global impression of change, and adverse events. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models and logistic regression.

Results:
A total of 298 participants were randomized (mean age 53.9 ± 10.5 years; 47% female). At 24 weeks, the ESI plus OCT group demonstrated a greater reduction in VAS pain scores compared with OCT alone (−3.8 ± 1.6 vs −2.0 ± 1.4; adjusted mean difference −1.8, 95% CI −2.2 to −1.4; p < 0.001). ODI scores improved more in the intervention group (−16.2 ± 8.7 vs −7.1 ± 7.9; p < 0.001), and SF-36 physical and mental component scores increased significantly (+10.2 vs +4.3 points; p < 0.001). Analgesic use decreased by 37.8% in the ESI group versus 16.9% in controls (p < 0.001). Adverse events were mild, including transient injection-site pain (6.4%) and headache (3.1%), with no serious events reported.

Conclusions:
In adults with chronic low back pain, epidural steroid injections combined with optimized conservative therapy provided superior pain relief, functional improvement, and quality-of-life benefits compared with conservative therapy alone over 24 weeks, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support ESIs as an effective adjunctive treatment for persistent CLBP.
