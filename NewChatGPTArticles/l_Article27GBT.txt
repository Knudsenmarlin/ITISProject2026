Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Exacerbations contribute to disease progression, hospitalizations, and reduced quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is recommended for symptom management and functional improvement, but access to center-based programs is limited. Home-based, telemonitored PR may offer a practical alternative, yet evidence for its efficacy is sparse. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a structured home-based, telemonitored PR program compared with usual care in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.

Methods:
We conducted a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at seven tertiary care centers between March 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 40–80 years with COPD (GOLD stage II–III) and ≥1 exacerbation in the previous year were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a 24-week home-based PR program with telemonitoring support—including supervised exercise, education, and weekly virtual coaching—or usual care. The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, health-related quality of life (St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ), frequency of exacerbations, and program adherence. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 312 participants were randomized (mean age 65.4 ± 9.1 years; 54% male). At 24 weeks, the home-based PR group demonstrated a greater improvement in 6MWD compared with usual care (mean increase 52.7 ± 34.1 m vs 14.6 ± 28.9 m; adjusted mean difference 38.1 m, 95% CI 31.2–45.0; p < 0.001). CAT scores decreased more in the intervention group (−6.4 vs −2.1; p < 0.001), mMRC scores improved (−1.2 vs −0.4; p < 0.001), and SGRQ total scores improved significantly (−12.8 vs −3.6 points; p < 0.001). The rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations was lower in the PR group (0.32 vs 0.56 per patient-year; p = 0.01). Adherence was high, with 82% completing ≥75% of prescribed sessions. No serious adverse events related to the program were reported.

Conclusions:
Home-based, telemonitored pulmonary rehabilitation significantly improved exercise capacity, symptoms, quality of life, and reduced exacerbations in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. These findings support the implementation of home-based PR programs as a safe and effective alternative to center-based rehabilitation.
