Background:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in large clinical trials, yet real-world data evaluating their effectiveness and safety in routine clinical practice remain limited. This study aimed to assess the cardiovascular and renal outcomes associated with SGLT2i therapy compared with standard glucose-lowering treatments in adults with T2DM.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study using electronic health records from January 2018 to December 2023. Adults aged 40–85 years with T2DM who initiated either an SGLT2i or standard oral glucose-lowering therapy were eligible. Propensity score matching was performed to balance baseline characteristics between groups. The primary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death, over a median follow-up of 24 months. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), all-cause mortality, and safety outcomes such as genital infections, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hypoglycemia. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Results:
A total of 3,412 patients were included after matching (mean age 62.5 ± 10.8 years; 48% female). The incidence of MACE was significantly lower in the SGLT2i group compared with standard therapy (4.6 vs 7.8 events per 100 person-years; HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45–0.74; p < 0.001). Hospitalizations for heart failure were reduced (2.3 vs 5.1 events per 100 person-years; HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31–0.63; p < 0.001), and the rate of CKD progression was slower in the SGLT2i group (3.2 vs 5.6 events per 100 person-years; HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42–0.78; p = 0.001). All-cause mortality was also lower among SGLT2i users (3.8 vs 6.5 events per 100 person-years; HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44–0.81; p = 0.001). Genital infections were more frequent with SGLT2i therapy (5.4% vs 1.2%; p < 0.001), while rates of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis were similar between groups.

Conclusions:
In adults with T2DM, initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy was associated with reduced risk of major cardiovascular events, heart failure hospitalization, CKD progression, and all-cause mortality compared with standard glucose-lowering therapy. These findings support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as a cardioprotective and renoprotective strategy in routine clinical practice.
