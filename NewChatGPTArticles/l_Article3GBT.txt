Postoperative delirium is a common and serious complication among older adults undergoing major surgery, associated with prolonged hospitalization, functional decline, and increased mortality. Pharmacologic prevention strategies have yielded inconsistent results, and nonpharmacologic interventions remain variably implemented. Multicomponent perioperative delirium prevention bundles may reduce delirium incidence, but evidence from randomized trials in orthopedic surgery is limited. This study assessed the effectiveness of a standardized delirium prevention bundle in older adults undergoing elective hip fracture repair.

Methods:
We conducted a single-blind, randomized controlled trial at three academic hospitals between February 2019 and December 2022. Patients aged ≥65 years scheduled for elective or semi-elective hip fracture surgery were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either usual perioperative care or a delirium prevention bundle initiated preoperatively and continued through postoperative day 5. The bundle included orientation protocols, sleep promotion, early mobilization, hydration optimization, vision and hearing support, and medication review. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium within 7 days, assessed daily using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Secondary outcomes included delirium duration, length of hospital stay, in-hospital complications, discharge disposition, and 30-day mortality. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results:
A total of 612 patients were enrolled (mean age 78.4 ± 7.1 years; 61% female). Postoperative delirium occurred in 72 patients (23.5%) in the intervention group compared with 118 patients (38.6%) in the usual care group (risk ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.47–0.79; p < 0.001). Among patients who developed delirium, median duration was shorter in the intervention group (2 days [IQR 1–3] vs 4 days [IQR 2–6]; p = 0.01). The intervention group had a reduced median length of stay (6.2 vs 8.1 days; p < 0.001) and fewer in-hospital complications, including falls and urinary tract infections. A greater proportion of patients in the intervention group were discharged home rather than to skilled nursing facilities (42.8% vs 31.4%; p = 0.004). Thirty-day mortality did not differ significantly between groups (3.6% vs 4.2%; p = 0.68). No adverse events related to the intervention were observed.

Conclusions:
Implementation of a multicomponent perioperative delirium prevention bundle significantly reduced the incidence and duration of postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing hip fracture surgery. These findings support routine adoption of structured, nonpharmacologic delirium prevention strategies in orthopedic surgical care pathways.
