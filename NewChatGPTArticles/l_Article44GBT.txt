Chronic migraine is a disabling neurological disorder associated with frequent headache attacks, reduced quality of life, and high socioeconomic burden. Despite available preventive therapies, a significant proportion of patients continue to experience frequent attacks. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have emerged as a novel preventive therapy, but comparative real-world data are limited. This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and patient-reported outcomes of monthly CGRP monoclonal antibody therapy compared with standard oral preventive therapy in adults with chronic migraine.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded trial at ten neurology centers between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 18–65 years with chronic migraine (≥15 headache days per month for ≥3 months) and inadequate response to at least two prior oral preventive agents were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either monthly subcutaneous CGRP monoclonal antibody therapy or optimized oral preventive therapy for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was change in monthly migraine days (MMD) from baseline to week 24. Secondary outcomes included responder rates (≥50% reduction in MMD), Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) scores, quality of life (Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, MSQ), acute medication use, and adverse events. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models and logistic regression.

Results:
A total of 276 participants were randomized (mean age 42.6 ± 10.3 years; 78% female). At week 24, the CGRP monoclonal antibody group demonstrated a greater reduction in MMD compared with oral therapy (−10.8 ± 5.2 vs −5.1 ± 4.7 days; adjusted mean difference −5.7 days, 95% CI −6.9 to −4.5; p < 0.001). Responder rates were higher in the CGRP group (62.3% vs 28.7%; p < 0.001). MIDAS scores improved significantly (−28.4 ± 12.1 vs −14.7 ± 11.3; p < 0.001), as did MSQ scores (+18.7 vs +8.4 points; p < 0.001). Acute medication use decreased more in the CGRP group (−6.1 vs −2.7 days; p < 0.001). Adverse events were generally mild, including injection-site reactions (7.9%) and transient constipation (4.3%), with no serious treatment-related events reported.

Conclusions:
Monthly CGRP monoclonal antibody therapy significantly reduced migraine frequency, improved disability and quality of life, and decreased acute medication use compared with optimized oral preventive therapy in adults with chronic migraine. The therapy was well tolerated, supporting its use as an effective preventive option for chronic migraine management.
