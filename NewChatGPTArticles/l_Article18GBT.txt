Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, progressive renal function decline, and high morbidity. Despite optimal medical therapy, many patients continue to experience disease progression. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have demonstrated renal and cardiovascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but their efficacy in patients with CKD regardless of diabetes status remains under investigation. This study evaluated the effects of SGLT2i therapy on renal outcomes in adults with CKD with or without type 2 diabetes.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 12 nephrology centers between February 2020 and March 2024. Adults aged 30–85 years with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 25–60 mL/min/1.73 m²) and albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] 30–3000 mg/g) were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either an SGLT2 inhibitor or matching placebo once daily in addition to standard care, including renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockade. The primary endpoint was a composite of sustained decline in eGFR ≥50%, progression to end-stage kidney disease, or renal or cardiovascular death over a median follow-up of 36 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in eGFR slope, UACR, hospitalization for heart failure, and safety endpoints. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using Cox proportional hazards models and mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 1,864 participants were randomized (mean age 62.8 ± 11.2 years; 43% female; 56% with type 2 diabetes). The primary composite endpoint occurred in 147 patients (15.7%) in the SGLT2i group versus 222 patients (23.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50–0.74; p < 0.001). SGLT2i therapy slowed eGFR decline (mean annual slope −1.7 vs −3.9 mL/min/1.73 m²; p < 0.001) and reduced UACR by 35% compared with placebo (p < 0.001). Hospitalizations for heart failure were lower in the SGLT2i group (4.3% vs 7.8%; HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.38–0.80; p = 0.002). Adverse events were generally mild, with slightly higher rates of genital infections in the SGLT2i group (4.6% vs 1.3%), while rates of acute kidney injury, hypotension, and hypoglycemia were similar.

Conclusions:
In adults with CKD, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy significantly reduced the risk of kidney disease progression, improved renal function, and decreased heart failure hospitalizations, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as a disease-modifying therapy in CKD regardless of diabetes status.
