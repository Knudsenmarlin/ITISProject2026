Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and frequent hospitalizations despite guideline-directed medical therapy. Angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) have demonstrated superior efficacy over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in clinical trials, but real-world data on functional outcomes and safety remain limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness and tolerability of ARNI therapy compared with standard ACEI therapy in patients with HFrEF.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint trial at 12 cardiology centers between January 2021 and October 2024. Adults aged 40–85 years with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%) and NYHA class II–III symptoms were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either ARNI therapy (sacubitril/valsartan) or standard ACEI therapy for 12 months. The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included NYHA class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause mortality, and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models and Cox proportional hazards models.

Results:
A total of 428 participants were randomized (mean age 66.2 ± 9.7 years; 37% female). At 12 months, the ARNI group demonstrated a greater improvement in 6MWD compared with the ACEI group (+48.6 ± 32.1 m vs +23.4 ± 28.9 m; adjusted mean difference 25.2 m, 95% CI 18.7–31.7; p < 0.001). NYHA functional class improved more frequently with ARNI therapy (63.1% vs 41.5%; p < 0.001), and KCCQ overall summary scores increased significantly (+14.3 vs +6.7 points; p < 0.001). Hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 11.2% of ARNI-treated patients versus 19.6% of ACEI-treated patients (hazard ratio 0.53; 95% CI 0.33–0.85; p = 0.008). All-cause mortality was numerically lower in the ARNI group but did not reach statistical significance (6.5% vs 9.8%; p = 0.18). Adverse events were similar between groups; hypotension was slightly more common with ARNI (8.4% vs 4.7%), while renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia rates were comparable.

Conclusions:
In patients with HFrEF, ARNI therapy significantly improved exercise capacity, functional status, quality of life, and reduced heart failure hospitalizations compared with standard ACEI therapy, with an acceptable safety profile. These findings support the broader use of ARNI as a first-line therapy in HFrEF management.
