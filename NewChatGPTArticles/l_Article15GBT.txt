Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric condition associated with substantial functional impairment, reduced quality of life, and increased healthcare utilization. While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remain first-line pharmacologic therapy, a substantial proportion of patients fail to achieve remission with initial treatment. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a noninvasive neuromodulation technique with demonstrated efficacy in treatment-resistant depression. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive rTMS compared with sham stimulation in adults with MDD who had an inadequate response to at least one antidepressant.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial at seven academic medical centers between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 18–65 years with a DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD, a baseline Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) score ≥20, and inadequate response to at least one antidepressant were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 4 weeks of daily high-frequency rTMS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plus continued pharmacotherapy or sham stimulation plus continued pharmacotherapy. The primary outcome was change in HAM-D17 score from baseline to week 4. Secondary outcomes included response (≥50% reduction in HAM-D17), remission (HAM-D17 ≤7), Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, quality of life (SF-36), and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 218 participants were randomized (mean age 42.6 ± 11.4 years; 61% female). At week 4, the rTMS group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in HAM-D17 scores compared with the sham group (−12.3 ± 6.4 vs −5.8 ± 5.7; adjusted mean difference −6.5, 95% CI −7.9 to −5.1; p < 0.001). Response rates were higher with rTMS (54.1% vs 22.9%; p < 0.001), as were remission rates (28.4% vs 10.1%; p = 0.002). MADRS scores and SF-36 mental health subscale scores improved significantly in the rTMS group compared with sham. Adverse events were generally mild and included transient headache (15.6%) and scalp discomfort (12.8%), with no serious adverse events reported.

Conclusions:
Adjunctive high-frequency rTMS significantly improved depressive symptoms and quality of life in adults with treatment-resistant MDD, demonstrating a favorable safety profile. These findings support the incorporation of rTMS into treatment strategies for patients with inadequate response to conventional antidepressants.
