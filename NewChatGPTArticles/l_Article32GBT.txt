Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and mortality. Despite standard therapy with metformin and other oral glucose-lowering agents, many patients fail to achieve adequate glycemic control. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated both glycemic and cardiovascular benefits, but real-world comparative effectiveness and safety data remain limited. This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and adherence of GLP-1 RA therapy compared with standard oral glucose-lowering therapy in adults with T2DM.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study at eight endocrinology clinics between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 35–75 years with T2DM and baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥7.5% who initiated either GLP-1 RA therapy or standard oral therapy (metformin, sulfonylurea, or DPP-4 inhibitor) were eligible. Patients were propensity score–matched 1:1. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, incidence of cardiovascular events, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Mixed-effects regression models were used to assess treatment effects.

Results:
A total of 1,024 patients were included after matching (mean age 58.6 ± 9.8 years; 52% female). At 12 months, the GLP-1 RA group achieved greater reductions in HbA1c compared with standard therapy (−1.3% vs −0.7%; adjusted mean difference −0.6%, 95% CI −0.7 to −0.4; p < 0.001). GLP-1 RA therapy was associated with significant reductions in body weight (−4.8 kg vs −1.2 kg; p < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (−6.2 mmHg vs −2.1 mmHg; p < 0.001). The incidence of major cardiovascular events was lower in the GLP-1 RA group (3.7% vs 6.5%; hazard ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.35–0.89; p = 0.01). Treatment adherence was higher with GLP-1 RA therapy (84.1% vs 72.3%; p < 0.001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent with GLP-1 RA therapy (12.8% vs 4.5%), while hypoglycemia was less common (2.1% vs 5.7%).

Conclusions:
In adults with T2DM, GLP-1 RA therapy provided superior glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and lower cardiovascular risk compared with standard oral therapy, with high adherence and a favorable safety profile. These findings support the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists as an effective treatment option in routine clinical practice.
