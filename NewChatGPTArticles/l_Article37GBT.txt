Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation, progressive cartilage destruction, and functional disability. Despite the availability of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), a subset of patients demonstrates inadequate response, leading to persistent disease activity. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have emerged as a targeted oral therapy for RA, but comparative real-world evidence on efficacy, functional outcomes, and safety is limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness and tolerability of the JAK inhibitor upadacitinib compared with standard DMARD therapy in adults with moderate-to-severe RA.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded trial at ten rheumatology centers between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 18–75 years with active RA (Disease Activity Score 28 [DAS28-CRP] ≥3.2) despite at least one prior DMARD were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive oral upadacitinib once daily or optimized conventional DMARD therapy for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving a DAS28-CRP remission (<2.6) at week 24. Secondary outcomes included change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), patient-reported outcomes (Short Form-36, SF-36), and incidence of adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using logistic regression and mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 312 participants were randomized (mean age 55.8 ± 10.4 years; 64% female). At week 24, DAS28-CRP remission was achieved in 38.5% of the upadacitinib group compared with 17.3% in the conventional DMARD group (odds ratio 3.01; 95% CI 1.87–4.85; p < 0.001). HAQ-DI scores improved significantly in the upadacitinib group (−0.61 ± 0.27 vs −0.32 ± 0.24; p < 0.001), as did CDAI scores (−18.4 ± 9.3 vs −10.7 ± 8.6; p < 0.001). SF-36 physical and mental component scores increased more in the upadacitinib group (p < 0.001). Adverse events were comparable between groups, with mild infections (upper respiratory tract infections) occurring in 9.3% of upadacitinib recipients and 6.7% of DMARD recipients. No serious drug-related events were reported.

Conclusions:
In adults with moderate-to-severe RA, upadacitinib therapy was associated with higher rates of disease remission, greater improvements in functional status and quality of life, and a safety profile comparable to conventional DMARD therapy. These findings support upadacitinib as an effective treatment option for patients with inadequate response to standard DMARDs.
