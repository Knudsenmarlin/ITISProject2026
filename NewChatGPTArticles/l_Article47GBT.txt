Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide despite guideline-directed medical therapy. Exercise intolerance and reduced quality of life are common in this population. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been shown to improve functional capacity in heart failure patients, but data on supervised home-based versus center-based programs are limited. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a 12-week home-based, telemonitored CR program compared with standard center-based CR in adults with HFrEF.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at nine cardiology centers between March 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 40–75 years with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–III symptoms were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a 12-week home-based, telemonitored CR program—including individualized exercise, remote monitoring, and weekly virtual coaching—or standard center-based CR. The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included NYHA functional class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores, quality of life (SF-36), hospitalization rates, and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 298 participants were randomized (mean age 63.2 ± 9.4 years; 62% male). At 12 weeks, the home-based CR group demonstrated a comparable improvement in 6MWD compared with center-based CR (+48.5 ± 29.3 m vs +51.2 ± 31.1 m; adjusted mean difference −2.7 m, 95% CI −8.6 to 3.2; p = 0.36). NYHA class improved in 57.8% of home-based participants versus 60.4% in the center-based group (p = 0.58), and KCCQ overall summary scores increased similarly (+14.1 vs +15.3 points; p = 0.42). SF-36 physical and mental component scores improved in both groups without significant differences. Hospitalization rates and adverse events were comparable, with no serious intervention-related events reported.

Conclusions:
In adults with HFrEF, a 12-week home-based, telemonitored cardiac rehabilitation program provided improvements in exercise capacity, functional status, and quality of life comparable to standard center-based CR, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support home-based CR as an effective and accessible alternative for patients with HFrEF.
