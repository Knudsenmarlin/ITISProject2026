Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and remains suboptimally controlled in many patients despite standard therapy. Renal denervation (RDN) has emerged as a potential interventional approach to reduce sympathetic activity and lower blood pressure. Previous trials have shown variable efficacy, and long-term data in patients with resistant hypertension are limited. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of RDN compared with optimized medical therapy in patients with resistant hypertension.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial at 14 cardiovascular centers between February 2020 and June 2024. Adults aged 30–75 years with resistant hypertension, defined as office systolic blood pressure ≥150 mmHg despite adherence to ≥3 antihypertensive agents including a diuretic, were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to undergo RDN plus continued pharmacologic therapy or optimized pharmacologic therapy alone. The primary endpoint was change in office systolic blood pressure at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, proportion achieving target blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg), renal function, cardiovascular events, and procedure-related adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models and Cox proportional hazards models.

Results:
A total of 372 participants were randomized (mean age 59.3 ± 9.6 years; 41% female). At 12 months, mean office systolic blood pressure decreased by 21.8 ± 14.7 mmHg in the RDN group versus 10.4 ± 13.2 mmHg in the control group (adjusted mean difference −11.4 mmHg; 95% CI −14.7 to −8.1; p < 0.001). Similar reductions were observed in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (−13.6 ± 11.9 mmHg vs −5.1 ± 10.7 mmHg; p < 0.001). Target blood pressure was achieved in 57.3% of RDN patients compared with 29.6% in the control group (p < 0.001). Renal function remained stable in both groups. No major procedure-related complications occurred; minor adverse events included transient flank discomfort (4.0%) and groin hematoma (3.2%). Cardiovascular event rates were numerically lower in the RDN group but did not reach statistical significance.

Conclusions:
In patients with resistant hypertension, renal denervation combined with optimized medical therapy significantly reduced office and ambulatory blood pressure compared with pharmacologic therapy alone, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support RDN as an effective adjunctive treatment for difficult-to-control hypertension.
