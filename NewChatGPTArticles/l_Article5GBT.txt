Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved survival in advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet a substantial proportion of patients experience primary resistance or immune-related toxicity. Biomarkers to guide treatment selection remain limited. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) dynamics may provide an early, noninvasive indicator of treatment response. This study evaluated the prognostic and predictive value of early ctDNA clearance in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving first-line immunotherapy.

Methods:
We performed a prospective, observational cohort study at six academic cancer centers between April 2019 and September 2023. Adults with stage IV NSCLC without targetable driver mutations who initiated first-line programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitor therapy, with or without chemotherapy, were eligible. Plasma samples were collected at baseline and at 6 weeks after treatment initiation. ctDNA was quantified using a targeted next-generation sequencing panel covering common NSCLC-associated mutations. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and association between ctDNA dynamics and immune-related adverse events. ctDNA clearance was defined as absence of detectable baseline mutations at week 6. Survival outcomes were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for clinical covariates.

Results:
A total of 312 patients were included (median age 64 years [IQR 57–71]; 44% female; 68% adenocarcinoma). Baseline ctDNA was detectable in 274 patients (87.8%). Among these, 121 patients (44.2%) demonstrated ctDNA clearance at week 6. Median PFS was significantly longer in patients with ctDNA clearance compared with those without clearance (11.6 vs 4.3 months; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.32–0.55; p < 0.001). Median OS was also improved (24.8 vs 11.2 months; adjusted HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34–0.63; p < 0.001). The ORR was higher among patients with ctDNA clearance (52.1% vs 18.7%; p < 0.001). ctDNA clearance was observed across PD-L1 expression subgroups and treatment regimens. Rates of grade ≥3 immune-related adverse events did not differ significantly between patients with and without ctDNA clearance (14.0% vs 16.8%; p = 0.52).

Conclusions:
Early ctDNA clearance following initiation of immunotherapy was strongly associated with improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC. These findings support ctDNA dynamics as a promising early biomarker of treatment benefit and may inform personalized immunotherapy strategies in clinical practice.
