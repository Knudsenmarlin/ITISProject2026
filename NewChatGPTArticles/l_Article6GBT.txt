Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent among patients with hypertension and contributes to poor blood pressure control and increased cardiovascular risk. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy improves sleep-related symptoms in OSA, but its impact on ambulatory blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension remains uncertain. This study evaluated the effect of CPAP therapy on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and cardiovascular risk markers in patients with resistant hypertension and moderate-to-severe OSA.

Methods:
We conducted a randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial at eight tertiary care centers between June 2019 and August 2023. Adults aged 30–75 years with resistant hypertension (office blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg despite use of ≥3 antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic) and newly diagnosed moderate-to-severe OSA (apnea–hypopnea index ≥15 events/hour) were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive usual antihypertensive care alone or usual care plus CPAP therapy for 6 months. The primary outcome was change in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure measured by ambulatory monitoring. Secondary outcomes included diastolic blood pressure, nocturnal blood pressure dipping status, markers of arterial stiffness, inflammatory biomarkers, and adherence to CPAP therapy. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results:
A total of 286 patients were randomized (mean age 58.9 ± 9.6 years; 36% female). At 6 months, the CPAP group demonstrated a greater reduction in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure compared with the control group (−7.8 vs −2.9 mmHg; adjusted mean difference −4.9 mmHg, 95% CI −7.1 to −2.7; p < 0.001). Reductions in 24-hour diastolic blood pressure were also greater with CPAP (−4.1 vs −1.3 mmHg; p = 0.002). A higher proportion of patients in the CPAP group converted from a nondipping to a dipping nocturnal blood pressure pattern (41.2% vs 18.6%; p = 0.001). Improvements in pulse wave velocity and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were observed in the CPAP group but not in controls. Mean CPAP adherence was 5.6 ± 1.4 hours per night, and greater adherence was associated with larger blood pressure reductions. No serious adverse events related to CPAP therapy were reported.

Conclusions:
In patients with resistant hypertension and moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, CPAP therapy significantly reduced ambulatory blood pressure and improved nocturnal blood pressure patterns over 6 months. These findings support the role of CPAP as an effective adjunctive treatment for blood pressure control in this high-risk population.
