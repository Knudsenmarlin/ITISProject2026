Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Early reperfusion through intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy improves outcomes, yet many patients remain functionally dependent. Neuroprotective agents targeting secondary injury mechanisms have shown promise in preclinical studies but limited clinical evidence. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the novel neuroprotective agent, Neuroxan, administered within 6 hours of symptom onset in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 15 stroke centers between March 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 18–85 years with acute ischemic stroke confirmed by imaging, presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset and with a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 6–20, were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous Neuroxan or placebo in addition to standard of care, including thrombolysis or thrombectomy as indicated. The primary outcome was functional independence at 90 days, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0–2. Secondary outcomes included change in NIHSS at 7 days, infarct volume on MRI at 72 hours, cognitive outcomes, and safety endpoints including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using logistic regression and mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 482 participants were randomized (mean age 66.1 ± 11.8 years; 52% male). At 90 days, functional independence was achieved in 214 patients (44.6%) in the Neuroxan group compared with 167 patients (34.8%) in the placebo group (odds ratio 1.52; 95% CI 1.12–2.06; p = 0.007). Mean NIHSS improvement at 7 days was greater with Neuroxan (−6.8 ± 4.3 vs −4.9 ± 4.1; p < 0.001). Median infarct volume was smaller in the Neuroxan group (18.2 vs 27.5 mL; p < 0.001). Cognitive outcomes at 90 days, measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, favored Neuroxan (+3.4 vs +1.7 points; p = 0.01). Adverse events were similar between groups; symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 3.7% versus 4.1% of participants, and no drug-related serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions:
Early administration of Neuroxan in patients with acute ischemic stroke improved functional outcomes, reduced infarct size, and enhanced neurological recovery without increasing adverse events. These findings support Neuroxan as a promising adjunctive neuroprotective therapy in the acute management of ischemic stroke.
