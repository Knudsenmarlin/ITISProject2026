Chronic migraine is a debilitating neurological disorder associated with substantial impairment in quality of life, work productivity, and daily functioning. Despite available preventive therapies, a significant proportion of patients continue to experience frequent migraine attacks. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies have emerged as a novel preventive therapy, but comparative evidence on efficacy and safety in real-world populations remains limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness and tolerability of monthly CGRP monoclonal antibody therapy compared with standard oral preventive therapy in adults with chronic migraine.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, assessor-blinded trial at ten neurology centers between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 18–65 years with chronic migraine (≥15 headache days per month for ≥3 months) and inadequate response or intolerance to at least two oral preventive agents were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either monthly subcutaneous CGRP monoclonal antibody therapy or optimized standard oral preventive therapy for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was change in the number of monthly migraine days (MMD) from baseline to week 24. Secondary outcomes included responder rates (≥50% reduction in MMD), Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) scores, quality of life (Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, MSQ), acute medication use, and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models and logistic regression.

Results:
A total of 276 participants were randomized (mean age 42.6 ± 10.3 years; 78% female). At week 24, the CGRP monoclonal antibody group demonstrated a greater reduction in MMD compared with the oral therapy group (−10.8 ± 5.2 vs −5.1 ± 4.7 days; adjusted mean difference −5.7 days, 95% CI −6.9 to −4.5; p < 0.001). Responder rates were higher in the CGRP group (62.3% vs 28.7%; p < 0.001). MIDAS scores improved significantly (−28.4 ± 12.1 vs −14.7 ± 11.3; p < 0.001), as did MSQ scores (+18.7 vs +8.4 points; p < 0.001). Acute medication use decreased more in the CGRP group (−6.1 vs −2.7 days; p < 0.001). Adverse events were generally mild, including injection-site reactions (7.9%) and transient constipation (4.3%), with no serious treatment-related events reported.

Conclusions:
In adults with chronic migraine, monthly CGRP monoclonal antibody therapy significantly reduced migraine frequency, improved functional outcomes and quality of life, and decreased acute medication use compared with optimized oral preventive therapy. The treatment was well tolerated, supporting its role as an effective preventive option for chronic migraine management.
