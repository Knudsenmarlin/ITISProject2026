Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are a leading cause of hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality. Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy reduces exacerbation frequency in some patients but may increase the risk of pneumonia and other adverse effects. Blood eosinophil count has been proposed as a biomarker to guide ICS therapy, but prospective evidence is limited. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ICS therapy stratified by baseline blood eosinophil levels in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 11 pulmonary centers between March 2020 and October 2024. Adults aged 40–80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD (GOLD stage II–III) and a history of ≥1 exacerbation in the previous year were eligible. Participants were stratified by baseline blood eosinophil count (<300 vs ≥300 cells/µL) and randomized 1:1 to receive inhaled fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination therapy or vilanterol alone for 52 weeks. The primary outcome was annual rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations. Secondary outcomes included time to first exacerbation, lung function (FEV₁), health-related quality of life (St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ), and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using negative binomial regression and mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 642 participants were randomized (mean age 65.2 ± 8.7 years; 57% male). In patients with eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL, ICS therapy significantly reduced the annual rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations compared with vilanterol alone (0.91 vs 1.38 events/year; rate ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.53–0.82; p < 0.001). No significant reduction was observed in patients with eosinophils <300 cells/µL (1.21 vs 1.30 events/year; rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.14; p = 0.48). ICS therapy improved pre-bronchodilator FEV₁ (mean change +120 mL vs +45 mL; p = 0.01) and SGRQ total scores (−6.2 vs −2.1 points; p = 0.003) in the overall population. Pneumonia incidence was higher in the ICS group (5.9% vs 2.1%; p = 0.02), while other adverse events were similar between groups.

Conclusions:
In patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, ICS therapy significantly reduced exacerbations and improved lung function and quality of life in those with elevated blood eosinophil counts (≥300 cells/µL), while benefits were limited in patients with lower eosinophil levels. These findings support the use of blood eosinophil counts as a biomarker to guide ICS therapy in COPD.
