Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory disorder associated with airflow limitation, frequent exacerbations, and impaired quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves exercise capacity and symptoms, but access to center-based programs is often limited. Home-based, telemonitored PR may provide a feasible alternative, yet robust clinical evidence is limited. This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and adherence of a structured home-based, telemonitored PR program compared with standard care in adults with moderate-to-severe COPD.

Methods:
We conducted a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at seven tertiary care centers between March 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 40–80 years with COPD (GOLD stage II–III) and ≥1 exacerbation in the previous year were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to a home-based PR program with telemonitoring support—including individualized exercise, weekly virtual coaching, and education—or standard care. The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), frequency of exacerbations, and program adherence. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 318 participants were randomized (mean age 65.4 ± 9.3 years; 55% male). At 24 weeks, the home-based PR group demonstrated greater improvement in 6MWD compared with standard care (mean increase 53.8 ± 32.5 m vs 15.1 ± 28.9 m; adjusted mean difference 38.7 m, 95% CI 31.9–45.5; p < 0.001). CAT scores decreased more in the intervention group (−6.5 vs −2.1; p < 0.001), mMRC scores improved (−1.2 vs −0.4; p < 0.001), and SGRQ total scores improved significantly (−12.9 vs −3.7 points; p < 0.001). The rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations was lower in the PR group (0.33 vs 0.58 per patient-year; p = 0.01). Adherence was high, with 82% of participants completing ≥75% of prescribed sessions. No serious adverse events related to the intervention were reported.

Conclusions:
Home-based, telemonitored pulmonary rehabilitation significantly improved exercise capacity, symptoms, quality of life, and reduced exacerbation frequency in adults with moderate-to-severe COPD. These findings support home-based PR as a safe, effective, and accessible alternative to center-based programs.
