Background:
Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is associated with significant functional impairment and reduced quality of life. Standard management includes pharmacologic therapy, physical rehabilitation, and lifestyle modification, but many patients continue to experience persistent pain. Minimally invasive interventional procedures, such as epidural steroid injections (ESI), are frequently used to alleviate symptoms, yet comparative effectiveness data and long-term safety outcomes remain limited. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ESI compared with optimized conservative therapy in adults with CLBP.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at nine pain management centers between January 2021 and November 2024. Adults aged 25–75 years with CLBP for ≥6 months, an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score ≥30, and no prior spinal surgery within 12 months were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either ESI plus optimized conservative therapy (OCT) or OCT alone for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity at 24 weeks, measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included ODI scores, patient-reported quality of life (SF-36), analgesic consumption, global patient satisfaction, and incidence of adverse events. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models and logistic regression.

Results:
A total of 312 participants were randomized (mean age 54.2 ± 10.1 years; 49% female). At 24 weeks, the ESI plus OCT group demonstrated a greater reduction in VAS pain scores compared with OCT alone (−3.9 ± 1.7 vs −2.1 ± 1.5; adjusted mean difference −1.8, 95% CI −2.2 to −1.4; p < 0.001). ODI scores improved more in the intervention group (−16.4 ± 8.9 vs −7.5 ± 7.8; p < 0.001), and SF-36 physical component scores increased significantly (+9.8 vs +4.1 points; p < 0.001). Analgesic consumption decreased by 38.2% in the ESI group versus 17.5% in the control group (p < 0.001). Adverse events were mild and included transient injection-site pain (6.7%) and short-term headache (3.2%), with no serious events reported.

Conclusions:
In adults with chronic low back pain, epidural steroid injections combined with optimized conservative therapy significantly improved pain, functional status, and quality of life compared with conservative therapy alone, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support the use of ESI as an effective adjunctive treatment for patients with persistent CLBP.
