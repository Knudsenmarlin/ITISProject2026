Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a growing public health concern associated with high morbidity, mortality, and frequent hospitalizations. Despite multiple pharmacologic interventions, effective therapies that improve clinical outcomes in HFpEF remain limited. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown promise in improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but their role in HFpEF has not been fully established. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SGLT2i therapy in patients with HFpEF.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 14 academic centers between March 2020 and December 2024. Adults aged ≥50 years with symptomatic HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%), elevated natriuretic peptide levels, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II–IV symptoms were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive SGLT2i therapy or matching placebo, in addition to guideline-directed medical therapy, for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. Secondary endpoints included change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores, all-cause mortality, and safety outcomes. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using Cox proportional hazards models and mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 642 participants were randomized (mean age 68.7 ± 9.2 years; 54% female). The primary endpoint occurred in 73 patients (22.8%) in the SGLT2i group compared with 108 patients (33.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47–0.84; p < 0.001). SGLT2i therapy significantly improved 6MWD (mean change +34.5 ± 21.7 m vs +12.1 ± 19.8 m; p < 0.001) and KCCQ overall summary scores (+8.9 vs +3.2 points; p < 0.001). All-cause mortality was numerically lower in the SGLT2i group but did not reach statistical significance (7.5% vs 9.8%; p = 0.18). Adverse events were comparable between groups, with a slightly higher incidence of genital infections in the SGLT2i group (4.1% vs 1.2%), while rates of volume depletion and renal adverse events were similar.

Conclusions:
In patients with HFpEF, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization and improved functional capacity and quality of life, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support the use of SGLT2i as an effective treatment option in HFpEF.
