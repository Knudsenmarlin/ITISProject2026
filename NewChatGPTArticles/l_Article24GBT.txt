Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a leading cause of disability and healthcare utilization worldwide. Standard management includes physical therapy, pharmacologic interventions, and lifestyle modifications; however, many patients experience persistent pain and functional limitation. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has emerged as a therapeutic option for refractory CLBP, yet high-quality evidence comparing SCS with conventional medical management remains limited. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SCS in patients with refractory CLBP.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at 10 pain management centers between March 2020 and September 2024. Adults aged 25–75 years with CLBP for ≥6 months, unresponsive to conventional therapy, and an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score ≥30 were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive SCS plus optimized medical management (OMM) or OMM alone. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity at 12 months, measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included ODI score, quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), opioid consumption, patient global impression of change, and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models and logistic regression.

Results:
A total of 276 participants were randomized (mean age 54.8 ± 10.3 years; 48% female). At 12 months, the SCS group demonstrated a greater reduction in VAS pain scores compared with OMM alone (−4.2 ± 1.7 vs −1.8 ± 1.5; adjusted mean difference −2.4, 95% CI −2.9 to −1.9; p < 0.001). ODI scores improved significantly in the SCS group (−18.5 ± 9.2 vs −7.3 ± 8.6; p < 0.001), as did EQ-5D-5L utility scores (+0.21 vs +0.08; p < 0.001). Opioid consumption decreased more in the SCS group (−42.3% vs −15.7%; p < 0.001), and 68.5% of participants reported “much improved” or “very much improved” on the patient global impression of change scale compared with 32.1% in the OMM group (p < 0.001). Device-related adverse events occurred in 8.7% of participants, including lead migration (4.3%) and implant-site pain (3.2%), with no serious device-related complications.

Conclusions:
In patients with refractory chronic low back pain, spinal cord stimulation combined with optimized medical management significantly reduced pain, improved functional status and quality of life, and decreased opioid use compared with medical management alone. SCS was generally safe and well tolerated, supporting its role as an effective therapeutic option in refractory CLBP.
