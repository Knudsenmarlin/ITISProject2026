Hypertension is a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Despite the availability of multiple antihypertensive agents, blood pressure control remains suboptimal in many patients, particularly those with resistant hypertension. Renal denervation (RDN) has emerged as a novel interventional therapy targeting sympathetic overactivity, but evidence regarding its long-term efficacy and safety is still evolving. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of RDN compared with optimized medical therapy in patients with resistant hypertension.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial at 15 tertiary care centers between January 2020 and December 2024. Adults aged 30–75 years with resistant hypertension, defined as office systolic blood pressure ≥150 mmHg despite adherence to ≥3 antihypertensive agents including a diuretic, were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to undergo RDN plus continued pharmacologic therapy or optimized pharmacologic therapy alone. The primary outcome was change in office systolic blood pressure at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, proportion achieving target blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg), renal function, cardiovascular events, and procedure-related adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 368 participants were randomized (mean age 58.2 ± 9.7 years; 39% female). At 12 months, mean office systolic blood pressure decreased by 22.4 ± 15.1 mmHg in the RDN group compared with 10.1 ± 13.4 mmHg in the control group (adjusted mean difference −12.3 mmHg; 95% CI −15.8 to −8.8; p < 0.001). Reductions in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure were also greater with RDN (−14.6 ± 12.3 mmHg vs −5.2 ± 11.1 mmHg; p < 0.001). Target blood pressure was achieved in 54.8% of RDN patients versus 28.3% in controls (p < 0.001). Renal function remained stable in both groups. No major procedure-related complications occurred; minor adverse events included transient groin hematoma (3.2%) and transient flank discomfort (4.1%). Rates of cardiovascular events were numerically lower in the RDN group but did not reach statistical significance.

Conclusions:
In patients with resistant hypertension, renal denervation combined with optimized medical therapy significantly reduced office and ambulatory blood pressure compared with pharmacologic therapy alone, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support RDN as an effective adjunctive therapy for patients with difficult-to-control hypertension.
