Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) remains a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospitalization among critically ill patients. Early and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is essential, yet overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance and adverse drug events. Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic stewardship has been proposed as a strategy to optimize antibiotic duration, but evidence in patients with HAP requiring intensive care is limited. This study evaluated whether a procalcitonin-guided strategy could safely reduce antibiotic exposure in patients with HAP admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial in 10 ICUs across three countries between January 2020 and December 2023. Adults aged ≥18 years diagnosed with HAP ≥48 hours after hospital admission and requiring ICU care were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either standard care guided by clinical judgment and guidelines or a procalcitonin-guided strategy in which antibiotic discontinuation was recommended when serum procalcitonin levels decreased by ≥80% from peak value or were <0.5 ng/mL. The primary outcome was total duration of systemic antibiotic therapy within 28 days. Secondary outcomes included ICU length of stay, ventilator-free days, recurrence of pneumonia, all-cause 28-day mortality, and antibiotic-related adverse events. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

Results:
A total of 524 patients were randomized (mean age 61.7 ± 13.4 years; 34% female). The median duration of antibiotic therapy was significantly shorter in the procalcitonin-guided group compared with standard care (7 days [IQR 5–10] vs 10 days [IQR 7–14]; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between groups in 28-day mortality (18.7% vs 20.2%; risk difference −1.5%, 95% CI −6.8 to 3.8) or pneumonia recurrence (9.5% vs 10.3%; p = 0.76). Patients in the procalcitonin group had more ventilator-free days (median 18 vs 15 days; p = 0.01) and a shorter ICU length of stay (median 11 vs 14 days; p = 0.02). Antibiotic-related adverse events, including Clostridioides difficile infection and nephrotoxicity, were less frequent in the procalcitonin-guided group (6.1% vs 11.8%; p = 0.03). Adherence to procalcitonin-guided recommendations was 82%.

Conclusions:
Among critically ill patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, a procalcitonin-guided antibiotic strategy significantly reduced antibiotic exposure without increasing mortality or recurrence of infection. These findings support the use of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic discontinuation as part of antimicrobial stewardship efforts in the ICU setting.
