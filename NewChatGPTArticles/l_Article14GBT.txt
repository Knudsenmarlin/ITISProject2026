Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a leading cause of pain and functional disability among older adults. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are commonly used for symptom relief, but their efficacy is often short-lived, and repeated injections may be associated with cartilage deterioration. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has emerged as a potential regenerative therapy, promoting tissue repair and reducing inflammation. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of PRP compared with corticosteroid injections in patients with symptomatic knee OA.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial at six orthopedic centers between March 2021 and November 2024. Adults aged 40–75 years with radiographically confirmed knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II–III) and moderate-to-severe pain (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] ≥40/100) were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a single intra-articular PRP injection or a standard corticosteroid injection. The primary outcome was change in knee pain at 6 months, assessed by VAS. Secondary outcomes included Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, patient global assessment, functional mobility (timed up-and-go test), and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 256 participants were randomized (mean age 61.3 ± 8.9 years; 58% female). At 6 months, the PRP group experienced a greater reduction in VAS pain scores compared with the corticosteroid group (−32.4 ± 15.7 vs −19.8 ± 14.6; adjusted mean difference −12.6, 95% CI −16.8 to −8.4; p < 0.001). WOMAC total scores improved more in the PRP group (−28.7 ± 12.5 vs −16.9 ± 11.8; p < 0.001), with significant improvements in pain, stiffness, and physical function subscales. Functional mobility improved modestly in both groups but was greater in the PRP group (timed up-and-go reduction −2.4 vs −1.1 seconds; p = 0.02). No serious adverse events were reported. Mild injection-site pain and transient swelling occurred in 12.3% of PRP recipients and 9.8% of corticosteroid recipients.

Conclusions:
In adults with moderate knee osteoarthritis, a single intra-articular PRP injection provided superior pain relief and functional improvement at 6 months compared with corticosteroid injection, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support PRP as an effective therapeutic option for patients seeking longer-term symptom management in knee OA.
