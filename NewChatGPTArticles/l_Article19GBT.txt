Osteoporosis is a major cause of fractures in postmenopausal women, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Although bisphosphonates are first-line therapy, adherence is often suboptimal due to gastrointestinal adverse effects and dosing complexity. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting RANKL, has emerged as an alternative therapy with a favorable dosing schedule and efficacy in fracture risk reduction. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of denosumab compared with oral bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial at 10 centers between January 2020 and December 2023. Postmenopausal women aged 55–85 years with a T-score ≤ −2.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg every 6 months or oral alendronate 70 mg weekly for 24 months. The primary outcome was percent change in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in total hip and femoral neck BMD, incidence of new vertebral and non-vertebral fractures, bone turnover markers, and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models and Kaplan–Meier estimates.

Results:
A total of 612 participants were randomized (mean age 67.4 ± 7.9 years; 100% female). At 24 months, lumbar spine BMD increased significantly more in the denosumab group compared with the alendronate group (+8.9% vs +5.1%; adjusted mean difference 3.8%, 95% CI 2.9–4.7; p < 0.001). Similar patterns were observed for total hip (+4.7% vs +2.3%; p < 0.001) and femoral neck BMD (+4.1% vs +1.9%; p < 0.001). The incidence of new vertebral fractures was lower with denosumab (1.6% vs 4.9%; hazard ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.14–0.73; p = 0.006), whereas non-vertebral fracture rates were similar (3.9% vs 5.2%; p = 0.42). Bone turnover markers were suppressed more rapidly and sustainably with denosumab. Adverse events were comparable between groups, with no unexpected safety signals; injection-site reactions occurred in 4.5% of denosumab recipients.

Conclusions:
In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, denosumab significantly increased BMD and reduced the risk of vertebral fractures compared with oral alendronate, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support denosumab as an effective therapeutic option for osteoporosis management, particularly for patients with adherence challenges to oral bisphosphonates.
