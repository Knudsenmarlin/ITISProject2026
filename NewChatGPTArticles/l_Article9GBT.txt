Post–acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly referred to as long COVID, are characterized by persistent symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, and cognitive impairment that can last for months after acute infection. Evidence-based treatments are limited, and structured rehabilitation programs have not been well studied in randomized clinical trials. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary outpatient rehabilitation program on functional capacity and symptom burden in patients with long COVID.

Methods:
We conducted a randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at five academic medical centers between July 2021 and November 2024. Adults aged 18–75 years with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent symptoms lasting ≥12 weeks were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either usual care or a 12-week multidisciplinary rehabilitation program comprising supervised aerobic and resistance exercise, respiratory therapy, cognitive training, and psychological support. The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included fatigue severity (Fatigue Severity Scale), dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council scale), cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), and work participation. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results:
A total of 384 participants were randomized (mean age 49.7 ± 12.8 years; 62% female). At 12 weeks, participants in the rehabilitation group demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in 6MWD compared with usual care (mean increase 62.4 ± 48.1 m vs 18.7 ± 41.5 m; adjusted mean difference 43.7 m, 95% CI 33.1–54.3; p < 0.001). Clinically meaningful improvements were also observed in fatigue scores (−1.6 vs −0.6; p < 0.001) and dyspnea (−0.9 vs −0.3; p = 0.002). Cognitive performance improved modestly in the intervention group but not in controls (MoCA +2.1 vs +0.6 points; p = 0.01). Quality-of-life indices increased significantly with rehabilitation, and a higher proportion of participants returned to work or usual activities at 12 weeks (68.2% vs 52.4%; p = 0.004). No serious adverse events related to the intervention were reported.

Conclusions:
A structured multidisciplinary rehabilitation program significantly improved functional capacity, symptom burden, and quality of life in patients with long COVID. These findings support the integration of comprehensive rehabilitation strategies into the management of post–acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
