Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with increased cardiovascular risk, renal complications, and reduced quality of life. Despite standard therapies, many patients fail to achieve optimal glycemic control. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated glycemic and cardiovascular benefits, but data comparing their effectiveness with standard oral therapies in real-world populations remain limited. This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and treatment adherence of GLP-1 RA therapy versus standard oral glucose-lowering therapy in adults with T2DM.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study at eight endocrinology clinics between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 35–75 years with T2DM and baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥7.5% who initiated either GLP-1 RA therapy or standard oral therapy (metformin, sulfonylurea, or DPP-4 inhibitor) were eligible. Patients were propensity score–matched 1:1. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, cardiovascular events, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Analyses were performed using mixed-effects regression models.

Results:
A total of 1,032 patients were included after matching (mean age 58.7 ± 10.2 years; 53% female). At 12 months, the GLP-1 RA group achieved greater reductions in HbA1c compared with standard therapy (−1.2% ± 0.5% vs −0.7% ± 0.4%; adjusted mean difference −0.5%, 95% CI −0.6 to −0.4; p < 0.001). GLP-1 RA therapy was associated with greater weight loss (−5.1 ± 3.2 kg vs −1.6 ± 2.5 kg; p < 0.001) and modest reductions in systolic blood pressure (−5.4 ± 6.8 mmHg vs −1.8 ± 6.3 mmHg; p < 0.001). Major cardiovascular events occurred less frequently in the GLP-1 RA group (3.5% vs 6.2%; hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.34–0.88; p = 0.01). Treatment adherence was higher with GLP-1 RA therapy (85.2% vs 73.9%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were generally mild; gastrointestinal events were more frequent with GLP-1 RA therapy (nausea 10.9% vs 3.2%), while hypoglycemia occurred less frequently (1.9% vs 5.1%).

Conclusions:
In adults with T2DM, GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy provided superior glycemic control, weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection compared with standard oral therapy, with high adherence and a favorable safety profile. These findings support GLP-1 RAs as an effective and well-tolerated treatment option in routine clinical practice.
