Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a leading cause of pain, functional impairment, and reduced quality of life in older adults. While nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy provide symptomatic relief, many patients continue to experience persistent pain. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA) injections have been proposed as a therapeutic option to improve joint lubrication, reduce pain, and enhance function, but evidence regarding their comparative effectiveness and safety remains variable. This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of HA injections compared with standard NSAID therapy in adults with symptomatic knee OA.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at seven orthopedic centers between February 2021 and November 2024. Adults aged 45–80 years with radiographically confirmed knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II–III) and moderate-to-severe pain (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] ≥40/100) were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a series of three intra-articular HA injections at weekly intervals or standard oral NSAID therapy for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in VAS pain score at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total and subscale scores, patient global assessment, functional mobility (timed up-and-go test), and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 284 participants were randomized (mean age 63.1 ± 9.7 years; 57% female). At 12 weeks, the HA group demonstrated a greater reduction in VAS pain scores compared with the NSAID group (−33.2 ± 14.6 vs −19.5 ± 13.8; adjusted mean difference −13.7, 95% CI −16.9 to −10.5; p < 0.001). WOMAC total scores improved more in the HA group (−28.1 ± 11.7 vs −15.6 ± 10.9; p < 0.001), with significant improvements across pain, stiffness, and physical function subscales. Functional mobility improved in both groups but was greater in the HA group (timed up-and-go reduction −2.3 vs −1.1 seconds; p = 0.01). Adverse events were mild and included transient injection-site pain (6.3%) in the HA group and gastrointestinal discomfort (5.4%) in the NSAID group, with no serious events reported.

Conclusions:
In adults with symptomatic knee OA, intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections provided superior pain relief, functional improvement, and patient-reported outcomes compared with standard NSAID therapy over 12 weeks, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support HA injections as an effective adjunctive treatment for knee OA management.
