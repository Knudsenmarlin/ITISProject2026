Background:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, and mortality. Despite standard glucose-lowering therapies, many patients fail to achieve optimal glycemic control. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have demonstrated glycemic, cardiovascular, and renal benefits, but comparative effectiveness in real-world populations remains limited. This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and adherence of SGLT2i therapy compared with standard oral glucose-lowering therapy in adults with T2DM.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study at eight endocrinology clinics between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 35–75 years with T2DM and baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥7.5% who initiated either SGLT2i therapy or standard oral therapy (metformin, sulfonylurea, or DPP-4 inhibitor) were eligible. Patients were propensity score–matched 1:1. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, incidence of cardiovascular events, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Mixed-effects regression models were used to assess treatment effects.

Results:
A total of 1,028 patients were included after matching (mean age 58.9 ± 10.1 years; 51% female). At 12 months, the SGLT2i group achieved a greater reduction in HbA1c compared with standard therapy (−1.1% ± 0.5% vs −0.6% ± 0.4%; adjusted mean difference −0.5%, 95% CI −0.6 to −0.4; p < 0.001). SGLT2i therapy was associated with greater reductions in body weight (−4.6 ± 2.9 kg vs −1.5 ± 2.3 kg; p < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (−5.7 ± 7.2 mmHg vs −1.9 ± 6.5 mmHg; p < 0.001). Major cardiovascular events were less frequent in the SGLT2i group (3.8% vs 6.5%; hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.36–0.91; p = 0.02). Treatment adherence was higher with SGLT2i therapy (84.5% vs 73.2%; p < 0.001). Adverse events were generally mild; genital infections were more common with SGLT2i (4.5% vs 1.8%), while hypoglycemia occurred less frequently (2.0% vs 5.4%).

Conclusions:
In adults with T2DM, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy led to superior glycemic control, weight reduction, blood pressure improvement, and lower cardiovascular risk compared with standard oral therapy, with high adherence and a favorable safety profile. These findings support SGLT2i as an effective and safe treatment option in routine clinical practice.
