Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is associated with high rates of hospitalization, mortality, and healthcare utilization. Remote patient monitoring using digital health technologies has been proposed as a strategy to improve early detection of decompensation and optimize outpatient management. However, evidence regarding its effectiveness in reducing clinical events in contemporary heart failure care remains mixed. This study evaluated the impact of a structured telemonitoring program on clinical outcomes in patients with HFrEF.

Methods:
We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical trial across 12 cardiology centers in Europe between March 2020 and June 2023. Adults aged 18–85 years with chronic HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%) and at least one heart failure–related hospitalization in the preceding 12 months were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either usual guideline-directed medical therapy alone or usual care plus a telemonitoring intervention consisting of daily home measurements of weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and symptom reporting transmitted to a centralized care team. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality or heart failure–related hospitalization at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the primary endpoint, quality of life assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), and adherence to guideline-directed medical therapy. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results:
A total of 1,032 patients were randomized (mean age 66.8 ± 10.7 years; 28% female). At 12 months, the primary composite outcome occurred in 198 patients (38.4%) in the telemonitoring group and 247 patients (47.9%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.63–0.91; p = 0.003). Heart failure–related hospitalizations were significantly reduced in the telemonitoring group (24.1% vs 32.6%; p = 0.002), while all-cause mortality showed a non-significant trend toward reduction (11.5% vs 14.2%; p = 0.18). Mean KCCQ overall summary scores improved by 9.4 points in the telemonitoring group compared with 4.1 points in the control group (between-group difference 5.3 points; p < 0.001). Patients receiving telemonitoring demonstrated higher rates of target-dose achievement for beta-blockers and renin–angiotensin system inhibitors. No intervention-related serious adverse events were observed.

Conclusions:
In patients with HFrEF, a structured telemonitoring program added to usual care significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization and improved health-related quality of life over 12 months. These findings support the integration of telemonitoring into comprehensive heart failure management strategies.
