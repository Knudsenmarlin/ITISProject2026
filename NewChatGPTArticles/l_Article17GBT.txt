Background:
Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability worldwide, and post-stroke motor impairment significantly affects functional independence and quality of life. Early, intensive rehabilitation can improve outcomes, but access to structured therapy is often limited. Robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) has been proposed as an adjunct to conventional physical therapy to enhance motor recovery. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of RAGT in improving gait and functional outcomes in patients with subacute stroke.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at six rehabilitation centers between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 18–80 years with a first-ever ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke within the preceding 2–12 weeks and residual gait impairment (Functional Ambulation Category [FAC] ≤3) were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either RAGT plus standard physical therapy or standard physical therapy alone for 6 weeks. The primary outcome was change in gait speed over 10 meters at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes included FAC score, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), lower extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-LE) score, Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 192 participants were randomized (mean age 63.1 ± 10.8 years; 54% male). At 6 weeks, the RAGT group demonstrated a greater improvement in 10-meter gait speed compared with the control group (mean change 0.27 ± 0.12 m/s vs 0.14 ± 0.10 m/s; adjusted mean difference 0.13 m/s; 95% CI 0.09–0.17; p < 0.001). Significant improvements were also observed in FAC score (mean increase 1.2 vs 0.6; p = 0.002), 6MWD (+68.5 vs +35.2 m; p < 0.001), and FMA-LE (+12.4 vs +6.3 points; p < 0.001). mRS scores at 6 weeks favored the RAGT group (median 2 vs 3; p = 0.01). No serious adverse events related to RAGT were reported; mild transient musculoskeletal discomfort occurred in 7.3% of participants.

Conclusions:
In patients with subacute stroke, robotic-assisted gait training combined with conventional physical therapy significantly improved gait speed, mobility, and lower limb motor function compared with standard therapy alone, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support the integration of RAGT into post-stroke rehabilitation programs to enhance functional recovery.
