Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory disorder characterized by airflow limitation, frequent exacerbations, and reduced exercise capacity. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is recommended to improve symptoms and quality of life, but traditional center-based programs are limited by accessibility and adherence. Home-based, telemonitored PR may offer a feasible alternative, yet evidence from randomized trials remains limited. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a structured home-based, telemonitored PR program compared with standard care in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.

Methods:
We conducted a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at seven tertiary care centers between March 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 40–80 years with COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] stage II–III) and ≥1 exacerbation in the previous year were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to a home-based PR program with telemonitoring support, including supervised exercise, education, and weekly virtual coaching, or standard care. The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes included COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), frequency of exacerbations, and program adherence. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 320 participants were randomized (mean age 65.1 ± 9.0 years; 53% male). At 24 weeks, the home-based PR group showed greater improvement in 6MWD compared with standard care (mean increase 54.2 ± 33.7 m vs 15.3 ± 29.1 m; adjusted mean difference 38.9 m, 95% CI 32.0–45.8; p < 0.001). CAT scores decreased more in the intervention group (−6.7 vs −2.3; p < 0.001), mMRC scores improved (−1.3 vs −0.5; p < 0.001), and SGRQ total scores improved significantly (−13.1 vs −3.8 points; p < 0.001). The rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations was lower in the PR group (0.31 vs 0.57 per patient-year; p = 0.01). Program adherence was high, with 81% of participants completing ≥75% of prescribed sessions. No serious adverse events related to the intervention were reported.

Conclusions:
Home-based, telemonitored pulmonary rehabilitation significantly improved exercise capacity, symptoms, quality of life, and reduced exacerbation frequency in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. These findings support home-based PR as a safe and effective alternative to center-based programs.
