Background:
Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a leading cause of chronic pain and functional limitation in adults, significantly impacting quality of life. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy are standard treatments, many patients continue to experience persistent symptoms. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACI) are commonly used to manage knee OA pain, but high-quality evidence comparing their efficacy with standard therapy is limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of IACI versus standard conservative therapy in adults with symptomatic knee OA.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at six orthopedic centers between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 45–80 years with radiographically confirmed knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II–III) and moderate-to-severe pain (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] ≥40/100) were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a single intra-articular corticosteroid injection plus standard care or standard care alone for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in VAS pain score at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total and subscale scores, timed up-and-go test, patient global assessment, and adverse events. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 268 participants were randomized (mean age 64.7 ± 9.2 years; 58% female). At 12 weeks, the IACI group demonstrated a greater reduction in VAS pain scores compared with standard therapy (−32.8 ± 14.2 vs −17.9 ± 13.7; adjusted mean difference −14.9, 95% CI −17.8 to −12.0; p < 0.001). WOMAC total scores improved more in the IACI group (−27.6 ± 11.8 vs −15.3 ± 10.9; p < 0.001), with significant improvements across pain, stiffness, and physical function subscales. Timed up-and-go performance improved modestly in both groups but favored IACI (−2.1 vs −1.1 seconds; p = 0.02). Adverse events were mild, including transient injection-site pain (5.9%) and minor swelling (3.7%), with no serious events reported.

Conclusions:
In adults with symptomatic knee OA, intra-articular corticosteroid injections provided superior pain relief and functional improvement compared with standard conservative therapy over 12 weeks, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support IACI as an effective adjunctive treatment for knee OA management.
