Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, and mortality. Despite standard glucose-lowering therapies, many patients fail to achieve adequate glycemic control. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated glycemic and cardiovascular benefits in clinical trials, but real-world evidence regarding their effectiveness, adherence, and safety remains limited. This study evaluated the impact of GLP-1 RA therapy compared with standard oral glucose-lowering agents in adults with T2DM.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study at eight endocrinology clinics between January 2021 and December 2024. Adults aged 35–75 years with T2DM and baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥7.5% were eligible. Patients initiating a GLP-1 RA were propensity score–matched 1:1 to patients receiving standard oral therapy (metformin, sulfonylurea, or DPP-4 inhibitor). The primary outcome was change in HbA1c at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, incidence of cardiovascular events, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Mixed-effects regression models were used to estimate treatment effects.

Results:
A total of 1,024 patients were included after matching (mean age 58.6 ± 9.8 years; 52% female). At 12 months, the GLP-1 RA group demonstrated a greater reduction in HbA1c compared with standard therapy (−1.3% vs −0.7%; adjusted mean difference −0.6%, 95% CI −0.7 to −0.4; p < 0.001). GLP-1 RA therapy was associated with significant reductions in body weight (−4.8 kg vs −1.2 kg; p < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (−6.2 mmHg vs −2.1 mmHg; p < 0.001). There was a lower incidence of composite cardiovascular events in the GLP-1 RA group (3.7% vs 6.5%; hazard ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.35–0.89; p = 0.01). Treatment adherence at 12 months was higher with GLP-1 RA therapy (84.1% vs 72.3%; p < 0.001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent in the GLP-1 RA group (12.8% vs 4.5%), whereas rates of hypoglycemia were lower (2.1% vs 5.7%).

Conclusions:
In adults with T2DM, GLP-1 RA therapy was associated with superior glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and lower cardiovascular risk compared with standard oral therapy, with a favorable adherence profile. These findings support the broader use of GLP-1 receptor agonists as an effective treatment option in routine clinical practice.
