Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent chronic liver disorder associated with metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and progressive liver injury. Currently, there are no approved pharmacologic therapies specifically for NAFLD, and lifestyle interventions remain the cornerstone of management. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated metabolic benefits and potential hepatoprotective effects. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RA therapy compared with standard lifestyle counseling in adults with biopsy-proven NAFLD.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial at eight hepatology centers between February 2021 and October 2024. Adults aged 30–70 years with NAFLD confirmed by liver biopsy and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous GLP-1 RA therapy once weekly or standard lifestyle counseling for 48 weeks. The primary outcome was change in liver fat fraction assessed by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Secondary outcomes included changes in ALT, fibrosis markers, body weight, glycemic parameters, and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 238 participants were randomized (mean age 54.2 ± 9.8 years; 56% female; mean BMI 32.7 ± 4.5 kg/m²). At 48 weeks, the GLP-1 RA group demonstrated a greater reduction in liver fat fraction compared with lifestyle counseling (−12.3% ± 6.1% vs −4.8% ± 5.7%; adjusted mean difference −7.5%, 95% CI −8.9 to −6.1; p < 0.001). ALT levels decreased significantly in the GLP-1 RA group (−34.7 ± 18.2 U/L vs −12.3 ± 15.6 U/L; p < 0.001). Improvements in noninvasive fibrosis scores were observed in the GLP-1 RA group but not in controls (p = 0.02). Participants receiving GLP-1 RA therapy experienced greater weight loss (−7.8 ± 3.5 kg vs −2.1 ± 2.8 kg; p < 0.001) and improved fasting glucose and HbA1c. Adverse events were primarily mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea 11.3%, diarrhea 7.6%), with no serious drug-related events reported.

Conclusions:
In adults with NAFLD, GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy significantly reduced hepatic fat content, improved liver enzymes, promoted weight loss, and improved glycemic parameters compared with lifestyle counseling alone, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support GLP-1 RAs as a promising therapeutic option for NAFLD management.
