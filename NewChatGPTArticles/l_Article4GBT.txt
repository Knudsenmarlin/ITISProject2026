Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is associated with substantial socioeconomic burden. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including exercise-based therapies, are recommended as first-line treatment; however, comparative effectiveness among different exercise modalities remains uncertain. This study evaluated the efficacy of a structured, supervised yoga-based intervention compared with standard physical therapy in reducing pain and improving function in adults with CLBP.

Methods:
We conducted a randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded clinical trial at four outpatient rehabilitation centers in the United States between January 2021 and May 2024. Adults aged 25–70 years with nonspecific CLBP persisting for ≥6 months and a baseline pain score of ≥4 on a 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS) were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a 12-week yoga-based intervention (two supervised sessions per week plus home practice) or standard physical therapy consisting of individualized strengthening and flexibility exercises. The primary outcome was change in average low back pain intensity (NRS) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included functional disability measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), health-related quality of life (SF-36), analgesic medication use, and durability of treatment effects at 24 weeks. Analyses were conducted using an intention-to-treat approach.

Results:
A total of 428 participants were randomized (mean age 49.6 ± 11.2 years; 58% female). At 12 weeks, participants in the yoga group experienced a greater reduction in pain intensity compared with the physical therapy group (−2.8 vs −1.9 points; adjusted mean difference −0.9, 95% CI −1.2 to −0.6; p < 0.001). Functional disability improved significantly in the yoga group, with a greater reduction in ODI scores (−14.6 vs −9.1 points; p < 0.001). Improvements in SF-36 physical component scores were also greater with yoga (mean difference 5.8 points; p = 0.002). Reductions in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use were observed in both groups but were more pronounced in the yoga group (−38% vs −22%; p = 0.01). Treatment effects were largely sustained at 24 weeks. Adverse events were infrequent and mild, consisting primarily of transient musculoskeletal discomfort, with no significant differences between groups.

Conclusions:
In adults with chronic low back pain, a structured yoga-based intervention resulted in greater reductions in pain and disability compared with standard physical therapy over 12 weeks, with sustained benefits at 24 weeks. These findings support yoga as an effective and safe nonpharmacologic treatment option for chronic low back pain.
