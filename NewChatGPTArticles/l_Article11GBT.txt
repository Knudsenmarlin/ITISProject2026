Background:
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle interventions remain the cornerstone of therapy, but adherence is often suboptimal, and pharmacologic treatment options are limited. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated metabolic benefits and potential hepatoprotective effects. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a GLP-1 RA in reducing liver fat and improving metabolic and hepatic outcomes in adults with NAFLD.

Methods:
We conducted a 48-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at seven tertiary care centers between January 2021 and February 2025. Adults aged 30–70 years with biopsy- or imaging-confirmed NAFLD and body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m² were eligible. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either subcutaneous GLP-1 RA therapy or placebo, in addition to standard lifestyle counseling. The primary endpoint was relative reduction in hepatic fat fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging–proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) at 48 weeks. Secondary endpoints included changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), body weight, glycemic parameters, and adverse events. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 328 participants were randomized (mean age 52.6 ± 10.4 years; 61% female). At 48 weeks, mean relative reduction in hepatic fat fraction was greater in the GLP-1 RA group compared with placebo (−38.7% vs −11.4%; adjusted mean difference −27.3%, 95% CI −32.1 to −22.5; p < 0.001). ALT and AST levels decreased significantly in the GLP-1 RA group (mean change −22.5 vs −7.6 U/L for ALT; p < 0.001). Improvements in HOMA-IR (−2.1 vs −0.5; p < 0.001) and body weight (−7.6 vs −2.1 kg; p < 0.001) were observed. Glycemic control improved in participants with type 2 diabetes (mean HbA1c reduction −0.9%). Gastrointestinal adverse events, primarily nausea and diarrhea, were more common with GLP-1 RA therapy (21.0% vs 7.3%), but serious adverse events were rare and balanced between groups.

Conclusions:
GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy significantly reduced hepatic fat content and improved liver enzymes, insulin resistance, and body weight in adults with NAFLD over 48 weeks. These findings support GLP-1 RAs as a promising therapeutic option for patients with NAFLD, particularly in the context of metabolic comorbidities.
