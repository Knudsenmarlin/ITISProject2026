Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global health burden associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Novel glucose-lowering agents have demonstrated cardiometabolic benefits beyond glycemic control, but their effectiveness in routine clinical practice remains incompletely characterized. This study evaluated the real-world effectiveness and safety of a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) compared with standard glucose-lowering therapy in adults with T2DM.

Methods:
We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data from five tertiary care hospitals between January 2018 and December 2022. Adults aged 40–80 years with T2DM and baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥7.5% were included. Patients initiating an SGLT2i were propensity score–matched 1:1 to patients receiving non-SGLT2i standard therapy. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, systolic blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Safety outcomes included rates of genital infections, hypoglycemia, and acute kidney injury. Mixed-effects regression models were used to estimate treatment effects.

Results:
A total of 2,184 patients were included after matching (mean age 62.3 ± 9.1 years; 46% female). At 12 months, patients receiving SGLT2i therapy demonstrated a greater reduction in HbA1c compared with standard therapy (−1.1% vs −0.6%; adjusted mean difference −0.5%, 95% CI −0.6 to −0.4; p < 0.001). SGLT2i use was also associated with significant reductions in body weight (−3.2 kg vs −0.8 kg; p < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (−6.5 mmHg vs −2.1 mmHg; p < 0.001). Decline in eGFR was slower in the SGLT2i group (−0.9 vs −2.7 mL/min/1.73 m²; p = 0.02). The incidence of MACE was lower among SGLT2i users (3.8 vs 6.1 events per 100 person-years; hazard ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.48–0.81). Genital infections were more frequent in the SGLT2i group, while rates of hypoglycemia and acute kidney injury were similar between groups.

Conclusions:
In routine clinical practice, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy was associated with improved glycemic control, favorable cardiometabolic outcomes, and reduced cardiovascular events compared with standard therapy in patients with T2DM. These findings support the broader use of SGLT2 inhibitors in appropriate patients, while highlighting the importance of monitoring for known adverse effects.
