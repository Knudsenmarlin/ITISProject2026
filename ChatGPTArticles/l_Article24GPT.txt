Background: Chronic low back pain is a leading cause of disability and healthcare utilization worldwide.

Objective: To compare the effectiveness of yoga-based therapy versus conventional physical therapy in reducing pain and disability in adults with chronic low back pain.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 180 adults with chronic low back pain were assigned to yoga-based therapy or standard physical therapy for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability scores. Secondary outcomes included medication use and quality of life.

Results: Both groups showed significant improvement; however, the yoga group demonstrated greater reductions in pain and disability and reduced reliance on analgesic medications. No serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusions: Yoga-based therapy is an effective alternative to conventional physical therapy for chronic low back pain management.
