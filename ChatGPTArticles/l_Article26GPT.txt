Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with increased risk of stroke and heart failure. Lifestyle factors may influence AF burden and symptom severity.

Objective: To evaluate the effect of structured weight management on atrial fibrillation burden and symptom severity in overweight and obese adults with paroxysmal AF.

Methods: This randomized controlled clinical trial enrolled 180 adults with paroxysmal AF and body mass index ≥27 kg/m². Participants were randomized to a structured weight management program including dietary counseling and supervised exercise (n = 90) or standard care (n = 90) for 12 months. The primary outcome was change in AF burden measured by ambulatory rhythm monitoring. Secondary outcomes included symptom severity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and quality of life.

Results: The intervention group experienced a significant reduction in AF burden (−38%) compared with controls (−12%; p < 0.001). Symptom severity scores and AF-related quality of life improved significantly, accompanied by reductions in body weight and improvements in aerobic capacity. No increase in arrhythmia-related adverse events was observed.

Conclusions: Structured weight management significantly reduces AF burden and improves symptom control in overweight and obese patients with paroxysmal AF.
