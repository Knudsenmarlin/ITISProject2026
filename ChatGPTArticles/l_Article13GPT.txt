Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver condition worldwide and is closely linked to obesity and insulin resistance.

Objective: To evaluate the effects of a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet on liver fat content and metabolic parameters in patients with NAFLD.

Methods: This 24-week randomized controlled trial included 140 adults with imaging-confirmed NAFLD. Participants were randomized to a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet or standard dietary advice. Primary outcome was change in liver fat content measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes included liver enzymes, insulin resistance, and lipid profile.

Results: The Mediterranean diet group demonstrated a significant reduction in liver fat (−28%) compared with controls (−8%, p < 0.001). Improvements in alanine aminotransferase, insulin resistance, and triglycerides were also observed.

Conclusions: A hypocaloric Mediterranean diet significantly reduces hepatic steatosis and improves metabolic health in patients with NAFLD.
