Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with progressive decline in glycemic control and increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Early intervention strategies aimed at improving insulin sensitivity may delay disease progression.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of intermittent fasting on glycemic control, insulin resistance, and inflammatory markers in adults with early-stage type 2 diabetes.

Methods: This 24-week randomized clinical trial enrolled 150 adults aged 30–65 years with type 2 diabetes diagnosed within the previous 3 years. Participants were randomized to an intermittent fasting intervention (16:8 fasting schedule, n = 75) or standard dietary counseling (n = 75). Primary outcomes included changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR. Secondary outcomes included body weight, lipid profile, inflammatory markers, and treatment adherence.

Results: At 24 weeks, the intermittent fasting group demonstrated a greater reduction in HbA1c (−1.1 ± 0.4%) compared with controls (−0.4 ± 0.3%, p < 0.001). HOMA-IR improved significantly in the intervention group (−1.6 ± 0.7 vs −0.5 ± 0.6, p < 0.001). Significant reductions in body weight, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein were observed. Adherence exceeded 80%, and no increase in hypoglycemic events was reported.

Conclusions: Intermittent fasting significantly improves glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in adults with early-stage type 2 diabetes. This dietary strategy may represent a safe and effective adjunct to standard diabetes management.
