Background: Hypertension remains a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite pharmacological advances, blood pressure control rates remain suboptimal, highlighting the need for effective adjunctive non-pharmacological strategies.

Objective: To assess the impact of a structured mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on blood pressure control and cardiovascular risk markers in adults with primary hypertension.

Methods: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 200 adults aged 35–70 years with diagnosed primary hypertension were randomly assigned to an MBSR intervention group (n = 100) or usual-care control group (n = 100) over 16 weeks. The intervention included weekly guided mindfulness sessions, daily home practice, and stress management education. Primary outcomes were changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring. Secondary outcomes included heart rate variability, serum cortisol, lipid profile, and health-related quality of life. Assessments were conducted at baseline and study completion.

Results: The MBSR group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (−11.4 ± 6.2 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (−6.8 ± 4.1 mmHg) compared with controls (−3.2 ± 5.8 and −1.5 ± 3.9 mmHg, respectively; p < 0.001). Significant improvements were also observed in heart rate variability and serum cortisol levels. Quality-of-life scores improved notably in stress, emotional well-being, and sleep quality domains. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported.

Conclusions: Mindfulness-based stress reduction significantly improves blood pressure control and stress-related cardiovascular risk markers in adults with hypertension. Incorporating structured stress-management programs may enhance standard hypertension care.
