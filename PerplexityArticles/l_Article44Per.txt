Title: Comparative Effectiveness of Early Physiotherapist-Led Rehabilitation Versus Standard Care After Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract:

Background: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) effectively relieves pain and restores mobility in advanced osteoarthritis, but postoperative recovery varies widely. Early, intensive physiotherapist-led rehabilitation may accelerate functional recovery and improve long-term outcomes, though evidence remains mixed. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of structured early rehabilitation compared with standard postoperative care following TKA.

Methods: In this single-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted at three orthopedic centers in Denmark, 300 patients aged 55–80 years undergoing elective unilateral TKA were randomized (1:1) to either early physiotherapist-led rehabilitation (EPR) or standard hospital-based rehabilitation (SHC). The EPR group began individualized, supervised sessions within 24 hours post-surgery and continued five times weekly for six weeks, focusing on early mobilization, muscle strengthening, and gait retraining. SHC participants received conventional physiotherapy starting 3–5 days postoperatively per national guidelines. The primary outcome was change in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) functional subscale at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included range of motion (ROM), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), pain (VAS), quadriceps strength, and incidence of readmissions or complications.

Results: Of 300 enrolled participants, 287 (95.7%) completed 12-week follow-up. The EPR group showed greater functional improvement (mean KOOS change + 32.1 ± 10.4) compared with SHC (+ 24.7 ± 11.5; between-group difference + 7.4; 95% CI 4.3–10.6; p < 0.001). At 12 weeks, mean knee flexion was 119° in EPR versus 111° in SHC (p = 0.02), and 6MWT distance improved by 74 m versus 51 m (p = 0.004). Pain scores declined more rapidly with EPR (−3.8 vs −2.9 cm on VAS; p = 0.01). No significant differences were found in readmission (3.1% vs 4.3%; p = 0.48) or adverse events. Patients in EPR reported higher satisfaction (mean 8.7 vs 7.9 of 10; p = 0.03).

Conclusion: Early physiotherapist-led rehabilitation initiated within 24 hours of total knee arthroplasty significantly improved short-term function, mobility, and pain outcomes without increasing complications. These findings support integrating early, intensive rehabilitation as standard practice to promote faster recovery following TKA.
