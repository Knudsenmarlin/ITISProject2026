Title: Effect of a Plant-Based Diet on Lipid Profile and Inflammatory Markers in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Background:
Dietary modification is a cornerstone of secondary prevention in coronary artery disease (CAD). Plant-based diets, rich in fiber and phytonutrients, may improve lipid metabolism and reduce systemic inflammation, yet evidence from randomized trials in individuals with established CAD remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a whole-food, plant-based (WFPB) diet compared with a standard heart-healthy diet on serum lipid profile and inflammatory biomarkers.

Methods:
This open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted at two cardiology clinics in Denmark between March 2023 and April 2025. Adults aged 40–80 years with angiographically confirmed CAD and LDL cholesterol ≥2.0 mmol/L were randomized (1:1) to follow either a WFPB diet emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds with minimal animal products, or a standard heart-healthy diet based on European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Both groups received dietitian counseling every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in LDL cholesterol from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included total cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), blood pressure, and body weight. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 220 participants were randomized (WFPB: n = 110; control: n = 110); mean age 63 ± 9 years, 71% men. At 12 weeks, the WFPB group had a greater reduction in LDL cholesterol compared with controls (–0.96 ± 0.42 vs. –0.52 ± 0.38 mmol/L; between-group difference –0.44 mmol/L; 95% CI, –0.59 to –0.29; p < 0.001). Total cholesterol decreased by –1.2 ± 0.6 mmol/L vs. –0.7 ± 0.5 mmol/L (p = 0.002), and triglycerides by –0.23 ± 0.18 mmol/L vs. –0.11 ± 0.14 mmol/L (p = 0.01). The WFPB group showed a 28% relative reduction in hs-CRP (p = 0.004) and modest declines in systolic blood pressure (–4.8 mmHg; p = 0.03) and body weight (–2.2 ± 1.3 kg; p < 0.001). No adverse nutritional deficiencies or major side effects occurred.

Conclusions:
A whole-food, plant-based diet significantly improved lipid and inflammatory profiles compared with a standard heart-healthy diet in patients with coronary artery disease. These findings support plant-centric nutrition as a safe, effective adjunct for secondary cardiovascular prevention. Longer-term studies are needed to assess adherence and effects on clinical outcomes.
