Title: Effect of Structured Mindfulness Training on Blood Pressure and Stress Markers in Adults With Stage 1 Hypertension: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract:

Background: Psychological stress is a major contributor to hypertension and cardiovascular disease risk. Mindfulness-based interventions have been associated with reduced blood pressure and stress biomarkers, but robust randomized data in early-stage hypertension are limited. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an 8-week structured mindfulness program in lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) and improving stress physiology in adults with untreated stage 1 hypertension.

Methods: In this single-blind, multicenter randomized controlled trial, 310 adults aged 30–65 years (mean baseline SBP 141.2 ± 4.9 mmHg) were randomly assigned (1:1) to a mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR; n = 155) or an active health education control (HEC; n = 155). The primary outcome was change in mean 24-hour ambulatory SBP at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included diastolic blood pressure (DBP), salivary cortisol awakening response, perceived stress (PSS-10), heart rate variability (HRV), and adherence. Measurements were taken at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6 months post-intervention.

Results: Of the 310 participants randomized, 296 (95.5%) completed follow-up. At 8 weeks, mean 24-hour SBP decreased by −6.7 mmHg (95% CI, −8.1 to −5.3) in the MBSR group compared with −2.9 mmHg (95% CI, −4.3 to −1.7) in the HEC group (between-group difference −3.8 mmHg; p < 0.001). DBP reductions were greater in the MBSR arm (−3.9 mmHg vs −1.6 mmHg; p = 0.004). Salivary cortisol decreased by 22% and HRV indices improved significantly (both p < 0.01). PSS-10 scores declined more strongly in MBSR participants (−7.2 ± 5.8 vs −3.9 ± 6.0; p = 0.002). At 6 months, BP improvements persisted but were partially attenuated (p = 0.03). No adverse events were reported. Adherence exceeded 85% in both groups, with higher engagement in meditation sessions correlating with greater SBP reduction (r = 0.41; p < 0.001).

Conclusion: An 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program produced clinically meaningful reductions in ambulatory blood pressure and stress biomarkers in adults with mild hypertension. These findings support mindfulness training as a safe and effective behavioral adjunct for early hypertension management and cardiovascular risk reduction.
