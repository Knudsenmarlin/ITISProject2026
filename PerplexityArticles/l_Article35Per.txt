Title: Effect of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on Blood Pressure and Psychological Well-Being in Adults With Stage 1 Hypertension: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Background:
Psychological stress is strongly implicated in the development and maintenance of hypertension. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a structured meditation program, has demonstrated benefits for stress-related disorders, but its impact on blood pressure control remains uncertain. This study evaluated whether an 8-week MBSR intervention lowers blood pressure and improves psychosocial well-being in adults with stage 1 hypertension.

Methods:
This single-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted at two university hospitals in Denmark between April 2023 and June 2025. Adults aged 30–65 years with untreated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 130–139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 80–89 mm Hg, free from major psychiatric or cardiovascular disease, were randomized (1:1) to either an 8-week MBSR program or health education control (HEC). MBSR participants attended weekly 2-hour group sessions and practiced mindfulness meditation at home for 30 minutes daily. The primary endpoint was change in office SBP at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included 24-hour ambulatory BP, perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS‑10]), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and quality of life (SF‑12). Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle using mixed-effects models.

Results:
A total of 228 adults were randomized (MBSR = 114; HEC = 114); mean age = 47.8 ± 9.3 years, 56% female. After 8 weeks, office SBP decreased by –7.6 mm Hg (95% CI: –9.8 to –5.4) in the MBSR group versus –3.2 mm Hg (95% CI: –5.6 to –0.8) in controls (p = 0.004). Ambulatory daytime SBP decreased similarly (p = 0.01). PSS‑10 scores fell by –5.1 ± 3.8 points versus –2.0 ± 3.6 (p < 0.001), and anxiety scores improved significantly (p = 0.02). Mental component scores on SF‑12 improved by +5.4 ± 6.2 points compared with +2.3 ± 5.9 in controls (p = 0.03). No adverse events were reported, and adherence exceeded 85%.

Conclusions:
An 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program produced significant reductions in systolic blood pressure and improvements in psychological well-being compared with health education alone in adults with stage 1 hypertension. These findings support the integration of mindfulness interventions into hypertension management as a safe, nonpharmacologic approach for cardiovascular risk reduction.
