Title: Efficacy of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation in Reducing Depressive Symptoms Among Adults With Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial

Abstract:

Background: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may exert antidepressant effects through modulation of neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter function. However, clinical evidence remains inconclusive regarding their efficacy as adjunctive treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD). This study evaluated the effectiveness and tolerability of omega-3 supplementation in adults with moderate to severe MDD receiving standard antidepressant therapy.

Methods: In this multicenter, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, 240 adults (aged 18–65 years) diagnosed with MDD according to DSM-5 criteria and baseline Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D₁₇) scores ≥18 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 2 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids (providing 1.4 g EPA and 0.6 g DHA) or placebo (olive oil). All participants continued stable doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The primary outcome was mean change in HAM-D₁₇ score from baseline to week 12. Secondary outcomes included response rate (≥50% HAM-D₁₇ reduction), remission rate (HAM-D₁₇ ≤ 7), anxiety (HAM-A), inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL-6), and safety/tolerability metrics.

Results: Of 240 randomized participants, 228 (95%) completed the trial. The omega-3 group demonstrated a greater mean reduction in HAM-D₁₇ scores compared with placebo (−10.2 ± 6.1 vs −7.4 ± 5.9; between-group difference = −2.8; 95% CI −4.4 to −1.3; p < 0.001). Response rates were 63.2% in the omega-3 group versus 41.7% in placebo (p = 0.002), and remission rates were 27.0% versus 15.7% (p = 0.03). Serum CRP and IL-6 concentrations decreased significantly in the treatment group (both p < 0.01), correlating with symptom improvement (r = 0.32, p < 0.05). Adverse events were mild and transient, including gastrointestinal discomfort (7.5%) and fishy aftertaste (5.0%); no serious adverse events occurred. Treatment adherence exceeded 90% in both arms.

Conclusion: Adjunctive omega-3 fatty acid supplementation significantly improved depressive symptoms and biochemical inflammatory markers in adults with MDD receiving SSRI therapy. These findings suggest that high-EPA omega-3 formulations represent a well-tolerated, beneficial adjunct treatment for major depression, warranting further investigation in long-term and mechanistic studies.
