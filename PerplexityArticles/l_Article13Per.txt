Title: Effect of Probiotic Supplementation on Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Gut Microbiota Composition in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Double‑Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial

Background:
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder associated with dysbiosis and altered gut–brain signaling. Probiotic therapy has emerged as a potential strategy to alleviate symptoms, but results remain inconclusive due to heterogeneity in study design and probiotic strains. This trial evaluated the efficacy of a multispecies probiotic supplement in improving gastrointestinal symptoms and modulating gut microbiota in adults with IBS.

Methods:
This double‑blind, placebo‑controlled, randomized clinical trial was conducted at two gastroenterology centers in Denmark between April 2024 and March 2025. Adults aged 18–65 years meeting Rome IV criteria for IBS were randomized (1:1) to receive either a daily probiotic capsule containing Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (10¹⁰ CFU total) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS‑SSS) from baseline to week 12. Secondary outcomes included changes in stool frequency and consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale), quality of life (IBS‑QoL questionnaire), and gut microbiota composition assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Statistical analyses used mixed‑effects models under intention‑to‑treat principles.

Results:
A total of 320 participants were randomized (mean age 41.7 ± 11.2 years; 68% female). At 12 weeks, mean IBS‑SSS decreased by 127 points (95% CI: –141 to –113) in the probiotic group versus 74 points (95% CI: –88 to –59) in the placebo group (between‑group difference –53 points; p < 0.001). Greater improvements were observed in both abdominal pain intensity (–2.1 ± 0.7 vs. –1.3 ± 0.6; p = 0.004) and bloating frequency (p = 0.01). Stool regularity normalized in 54% of probiotic recipients versus 32% of placebo recipients. Gut microbiota analysis revealed increased abundance of Bifidobacterium species and reduced relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in the probiotic group (p < 0.05). No serious adverse events occurred, and adherence exceeded 90% in both groups.

Conclusions:
Twelve weeks of probiotic supplementation significantly improved gastrointestinal symptoms, stool normalization, and gut microbiota composition in adults with IBS. The findings support the role of multispecies probiotics as a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for IBS management, warranting further investigation into strain‑specific mechanisms and long‑term benefits.
