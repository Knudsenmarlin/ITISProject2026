Title: Efficacy of Melatonin Supplementation on Sleep Quality and Inflammatory Markers in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial

Abstract:

Background: Sleep disturbances are common in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and contribute to heightened pain perception, fatigue, and systemic inflammation. Melatonin, a pineal hormone regulating circadian rhythm, also exhibits antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. This trial aimed to evaluate whether nightly melatonin supplementation improves sleep quality and reduces inflammatory activity in adults with active RA.

Methods: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted across three rheumatology centers in Denmark between March 2024 and February 2025. Adults aged 30–75 years with established RA (ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria) and a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score > 8 were randomized (1:1) to receive oral melatonin 5 mg nightly (n = 104) or placebo (n = 104), in addition to stable disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy. The primary outcome was mean change in PSQI from baseline to week 12. Secondary outcomes included changes in Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28), CRP, IL-6, fatigue (FACIT-F), and patient global assessment (VAS). Safety and adherence were monitored at 4-week intervals.

Results: Of 208 randomized participants, 201 (96.6%) completed the trial. At week 12, mean PSQI decreased by 4.7 ± 2.5 in the melatonin group versus 2.1 ± 2.3 in the placebo group (between-group difference = −2.6; 95% CI −3.3 to −1.8; p < 0.001). Significant reductions were observed in mean DAS28 (−0.9 vs −0.4; p = 0.002), CRP (−5.3 mg/L vs −1.6 mg/L; p = 0.01), and IL-6 (−1.8 pg/mL vs −0.5 pg/mL; p = 0.03). Fatigue and global assessment scores also improved significantly (both p < 0.01). Adherence exceeded 93% in both arms. Mild morning drowsiness occurred in 8.6% of melatonin users and 3.8% of controls (p = 0.09). No serious adverse events or therapy discontinuations due to side effects occurred.

Conclusion: Nightly administration of 5 mg melatonin for 12 weeks significantly improved subjective sleep quality and reduced inflammatory markers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving DMARD therapy. The intervention was safe, well-tolerated, and associated with modest improvements in disease activity and fatigue. These findings suggest melatonin as a promising adjunctive treatment to improve sleep and inflammatory outcomes in RA.
