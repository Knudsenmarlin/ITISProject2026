Title: Efficacy of a Telehealth-Based Cardiac Rehabilitation Program on Functional Capacity and Quality of Life After Myocardial Infarction: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract:

Background: Despite proven benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after myocardial infarction (MI), participation rates remain suboptimal due to barriers such as travel distance, scheduling conflicts, and limited program availability. Telehealth-based CR may offer a scalable alternative, but evidence comparing its efficacy to traditional, facility-based rehabilitation is limited. This study evaluated the clinical effectiveness, safety, and patient satisfaction of a structured telehealth CR program in post-MI patients.

Methods: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, 400 adults (mean age 59.3 ± 9.8 years; 27% female) who had experienced an MI within the previous six weeks were randomly assigned (1:1) to 12 weeks of telehealth CR (TH-CR; n = 200) or standard center-based CR (CB-CR; n = 200). The primary outcome was change in peak oxygen uptake (VO₂peak) measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included functional capacity (6-minute walk distance, 6MWD), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and adherence rates. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were recorded up to 6 months post-intervention.

Results: A total of 387 participants (96.8%) completed the trial. The TH-CR group demonstrated a mean increase in VO₂peak of 3.4 mL/kg/min versus 3.6 mL/kg/min in the CB-CR group (between-group difference −0.2 mL/kg/min, 95% CI −0.8 to 0.4; p = 0.47). Gains in 6MWD were comparable (+58 m vs +61 m; p = 0.61). Improvements in EQ-5D-5L and PHQ-9 scores were similar between groups (p > 0.05). Adherence was higher in the TH-CR group (89% vs 76%, p = 0.01), and patient satisfaction scores favored TH-CR (mean rating 9.2 vs 8.4, p = 0.03). No significant differences were observed in MACE incidence (3.5% vs 3.0%; p = 0.78).

Conclusion: Telehealth-delivered cardiac rehabilitation was non-inferior to standard, center-based programs in improving cardiorespiratory fitness, psychosocial outcomes, and safety following myocardial infarction. Higher adherence and satisfaction suggest telehealth CR as an effective and accessible alternative for post-MI care, particularly for patients facing logistical barriers to in-person participation.
