Title: Cognitive and Functional Outcomes of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Combined with Cognitive Training in Early Alzheimer’s Disease: A Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Trial

Abstract:

Background: Non-invasive brain stimulation has shown promise for mitigating cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), when paired with cognitive training, may enhance neural plasticity and cognitive performance in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tDCS combined with computerized cognitive training (CCT) in improving cognitive and daily functioning in patients with early-stage AD.

Methods: In this multicenter, double-blind, sham-controlled randomized trial, 186 participants aged 60–80 years with mild AD (MMSE 20–26) were enrolled across five European memory clinics. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either active tDCS (2 mA, 20 minutes, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) plus CCT administered five times per week for six weeks, or sham tDCS plus identical CCT. The primary outcome was change in Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included executive function (Trail Making Test B), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), caregiver burden (Zarit scale), and structural brain connectivity assessed by diffusion MRI. Safety and tolerability were monitored throughout.

Results: Of 186 randomized participants, 174 (93.5%) completed the study. Active tDCS + CCT resulted in a mean ADAS-Cog improvement of −3.4 points versus −1.5 in the sham group (mean difference −1.9; 95% CI −3.1 to −0.8; p = 0.001). Significant benefits were observed in executive function (−37.6 s vs −19.4 s; p = 0.004) and IADL (+2.3 vs +0.9, p = 0.02). MRI analyses revealed increased fractional anisotropy in frontoparietal tracts in the active group (p = 0.03). Caregiver burden declined modestly in both groups without between-group differences. Adverse events were mild, including transient scalp tingling and fatigue; none required discontinuation.

Conclusion: The combination of tDCS and cognitive training produced clinically meaningful improvements in cognition and functional performance in early Alzheimer’s disease, with good tolerability. Findings suggest that neuromodulation paired with training may represent a safe, non-pharmacologic adjunct for decelerating cognitive decline.
