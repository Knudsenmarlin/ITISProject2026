Title: Impact of Probiotic Supplementation on Gut Microbiota Composition and Symptom Severity in Adults With Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial

Abstract:

Background: Alterations in gut microbiota are implicated in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Probiotics may restore microbial balance and improve gastrointestinal symptoms, yet evidence on strain-specific efficacy and durability of effects remains inconsistent. This study evaluated the impact of a multi-strain probiotic formulation on gut microbiota diversity and symptom burden in adults with IBS.

Methods: In this 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, 320 adults (mean age 39.5 ± 11.2 years; 68% female) meeting Rome IV criteria for IBS were recruited from outpatient gastroenterology clinics in Denmark. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either a probiotic supplement containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Lactobacillus plantarum (total 1×10⁹ CFU daily) or an identical placebo. The primary outcome was change in IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) from baseline to week 12. Secondary outcomes included stool consistency (Bristol Stool Scale), microbiota alpha and beta diversity (16S rRNA sequencing), quality of life (IBS-QoL), and adverse events. Follow-up assessment occurred at week 16 to evaluate persistence of effects.

Results: Of 320 randomized participants, 308 (96.3%) completed the intervention. The probiotic group demonstrated a greater mean reduction in IBS-SSS score compared to placebo (−102.4 ± 58.7 vs −68.5 ± 60.2; between-group difference −33.9; 95% CI −46.8 to −20.9; p < 0.001). Improvements in bloating (p = 0.002), abdominal pain frequency (p = 0.01), and overall QoL (p = 0.004) were also noted. Gut microbiota analysis revealed increased alpha diversity (Shannon index + 0.35 ± 0.21 vs + 0.08 ± 0.19; p < 0.001) and enrichment of Bifidobacterium species in the probiotic arm, while diversity changes persisted four weeks after discontinuation. Adverse events were infrequent and mild, with no significant differences between groups (p = 0.72).

Conclusion: Twelve weeks of multi-strain probiotic supplementation significantly reduced symptom severity, improved quality of life, and enhanced gut microbial diversity in patients with IBS compared with placebo. The findings support probiotic therapy as a safe and effective adjunct for symptom management in IBS, with sustained microbial benefits beyond treatment cessation.
