Title: Impact of a Digital Smoking Cessation Program on Quitting Rates Among Adult Smokers: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Background:
Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Digital behavioral interventions provide scalable opportunities for smoking cessation, yet their long-term efficacy compared with standard counseling remains unclear. This trial evaluated the effectiveness of a smartphone-based smoking cessation program incorporating behavioral support, personalized feedback, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) reminders in adult daily smokers.

Methods:
This multicenter, open-label, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted across three primary care clinics in Denmark between March 2023 and April 2025. Adults aged 18–65 years who smoked ≥10 cigarettes daily and intended to quit were randomized (1:1) to receive a 12-week digital intervention or standard in-person cessation counseling. The digital program included daily interactive modules, motivational messaging, progress tracking, and scheduled live tele-support from trained counselors. Both groups had access to optional NRT. The primary outcome was biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included self-reported continuous abstinence, cigarette reduction rate, withdrawal symptoms (Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale), and treatment satisfaction. Analyses followed intention-to-treat principles using logistic regression models adjusted for baseline variables.

Results:
A total of 480 participants were randomized (digital group n = 240; control n = 240); mean age was 42.8 ± 10.5 years and 55% were female. At 6 months, verified abstinence was achieved in 33.3% of the digital group compared with 21.7% of controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.18–2.67; p = 0.005). Continuous abstinence rates were higher in the digital group (24.6% vs. 15.0%; p = 0.01). Mean daily cigarette consumption among non-abstinent participants declined by 42% in the digital group versus 27% in controls (p = 0.02). Withdrawal symptom scores were similar between groups, while treatment satisfaction was higher among digital participants (mean score = 8.4 vs. 7.1 on a 10-point scale; p < 0.001). No significant differences in adverse events or NRT usage were observed.

Conclusions:
A smartphone-based smoking cessation program significantly increased verified quit rates and reduced tobacco consumption compared with standard counseling in adult smokers. The digital platform was well tolerated and associated with high satisfaction, supporting its integration into primary care and population-based cessation initiatives. Future research should explore cost-effectiveness and long-term abstinence sustainability.
