Title: Effect of Remote Blood Pressure Monitoring With Pharmacist-Led Intervention on Hypertension Control: A Randomized Clinical Trial

Background: Uncontrolled hypertension remains a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Remote patient monitoring and pharmacist-led management are emerging tools to improve blood pressure control, but their combined effectiveness compared to standard care requires further evaluation.

Methods: This multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial was conducted across eight primary care networks in Denmark between April 2022 and July 2025. Adults aged 30–75 years with diagnosed primary hypertension (mean home systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg) were randomly assigned (1:1) to remote blood pressure monitoring with pharmacist-led medication management (intervention) or standard primary care follow-up (control). Intervention participants submitted weekly home BP readings via a digital platform linked to clinical pharmacies, where pharmacists provided medication titration in consultation with physicians. The primary outcome was mean change in systolic BP at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included diastolic BP, medication adherence (Morisky scale), patient satisfaction, and cardiovascular event incidence.

Results: A total of 1,004 participants were randomized (intervention n=502; control n=502). At 12 months, mean systolic BP decreased by 16.8 mm Hg (SD 9.5) in the intervention group versus 8.3 mm Hg (SD 10.1) in the control group (adjusted mean difference −8.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, −9.9 to −7.0; p < 0.001). Diastolic BP reduction was also greater in the intervention group (−6.2 mm Hg vs −3.0 mm Hg; p < 0.001). Medication adherence improved by 21.4% (95% CI, 18.3–24.5), and 89% of participants reported high satisfaction with digital monitoring. Cardiovascular events were rare and did not differ significantly between groups (1.4% vs 1.6%; p = 0.74). No serious adverse events were attributed to the intervention.

Conclusions: Integration of remote blood pressure monitoring with pharmacist-led intervention significantly improved hypertension control and adherence compared with standard care. These findings support the incorporation of remote clinical pharmacy services into national hypertension management strategies to enhance long-term outcomes.
