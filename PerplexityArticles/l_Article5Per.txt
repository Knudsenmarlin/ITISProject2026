Title: Effect of Early Nutritional Support on Clinical Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients With Moderate to Severe COVID-19: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial

Background: Malnutrition is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. This study evaluated whether early individualized nutritional support improves recovery and reduces complications compared with standard hospital nutrition care.

Methods: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial at 12 hospitals across Denmark, Sweden, and Germany between October 2021 and June 2025. Adults (≥18 years) hospitalized with confirmed moderate or severe COVID-19 and at risk of malnutrition (NRS-2002 score ≥3) were randomized 1:1 to receive early individualized nutritional support within 24 hours of admission (intervention) or standard hospital nutrition care (control). Nutritional support was guided by registered dietitians to achieve energy and protein targets (25–30 kcal/kg/day, 1.5 g protein/kg/day). The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU admission, length of hospital stay, incidence of nosocomial infections, and Body Mass Index (BMI) and serum albumin changes.

Results: Of 1,178 randomized patients, 1,142 completed the study (mean age 63.8 ± 12.4 years; 59% male). At 30 days, mortality was 9.6% in the intervention group versus 14.8% in the control group (relative risk 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49–0.86; p = 0.002). Early nutritional support significantly reduced ICU admissions (15.1% vs 23.7%; p < 0.001) and shortened median hospital stay (9.2 vs 12.8 days; p = 0.021). Participants receiving early nutritional therapy showed greater preservation of BMI (+0.4 kg/m² vs −0.7 kg/m²; p < 0.001) and higher mean serum albumin levels at day 14. The incidence of nosocomial infection was reduced by 28%. No adverse events related to nutritional intervention were reported.

Conclusions: Early individualized nutritional support in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 was associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality, fewer ICU admissions, and improved nutritional status compared with standard care. These results support the implementation of structured early nutrition protocols as an integral part of COVID-19 inpatient management.
