Title: Effects of High-Dose Vitamin D Supplementation on Immune Function and Infection Risk in Older Adults: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial

Abstract:

Background: Vitamin D plays an essential role in immune modulation, and deficiency has been linked to increased susceptibility to respiratory and systemic infections. However, the benefit of high-dose supplementation for infection prevention in older adults remains uncertain. This study assessed whether monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation improves immune function and reduces infection incidence in community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older.

Methods: In this 12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted across four primary care centers in Denmark, 520 participants (mean age 71.4 ± 5.2 years; 56% female) were randomized to receive either oral vitamin D3 100,000 IU monthly (n = 260) or placebo (n = 260). The primary outcome was the number of clinically confirmed infections (respiratory, urinary, and gastrointestinal) per participant-year. Secondary outcomes included serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, lymphocyte subset counts, proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6, TNF-α) concentrations, and self-reported quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). Safety was monitored via calcium and renal function testing.

Results: At 12 months, mean serum 25(OH)D levels increased from 56.2 ± 17.3 nmol/L to 129.7 ± 22.1 nmol/L in the vitamin D group compared with a modest rise to 61.8 ± 19.0 nmol/L in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The rate of infections was 1.7 per person-year in the vitamin D group versus 1.9 in controls (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.89; 95% CI 0.77–1.03; p = 0.11). However, participants receiving vitamin D had a 22% reduction in respiratory infections (p = 0.04) and significantly lower plasma IL-6 concentrations (−1.8 pg/mL; p = 0.02). No differences were observed in urinary or gastrointestinal infection rates. Quality-of-life scores improved modestly but not significantly between groups (p = 0.09). No cases of hypercalcemia or renal impairment were reported.

Conclusion: Monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation substantially increased serum 25(OH)D concentrations and modestly reduced respiratory infections and systemic inflammation in older adults, without adverse effects. While overall infection rates were not significantly different, these results support further evaluation of vitamin D as a potential adjunctive measure to enhance immune resilience in aging populations.
