Title: Efficacy and Safety of Low-Dose Semaglutide in Overweight Adults Without Diabetes: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial

Background: Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, is effective for glycemic control and weight reduction in diabetes. Its potential benefits in overweight adults without diabetes remain under investigation. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of low-dose semaglutide for sustained weight loss in non-diabetic individuals.

Methods: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 10 European centers between February 2022 and June 2025, adults aged 25–70 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 27–35 kg/m² were randomized (1:1) to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of semaglutide (0.5 mg) or placebo for 48 weeks, combined with standardized lifestyle counseling. The primary endpoint was percent change in body weight from baseline to week 48. Secondary endpoints included changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profile, insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR), and participant-reported quality of life. Safety assessments included adverse events and treatment discontinuations.

Results: Of 642 randomized participants, 615 completed the study. At week 48, the semaglutide group achieved a mean weight reduction of 8.7% (SD ±2.9) versus 2.3% (SD ±2.1) in the placebo group (mean difference −6.4%; 95% CI, −7.1 to −5.8; p < 0.001). Significant improvements were also observed in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid parameters. Gastrointestinal events were the most common adverse effects (19.6%), mostly mild to moderate. Serious adverse events occurred in 2.1% of participants, with no significant group differences.

Conclusions: Low-dose semaglutide significantly reduced body weight and improved cardiometabolic parameters in overweight adults without diabetes, with an acceptable safety profile. These findings support further investigation into low-dose GLP-1 agonists as adjuncts to lifestyle interventions for weight management.
