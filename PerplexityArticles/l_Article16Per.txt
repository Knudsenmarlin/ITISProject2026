Title: Comparative Efficacy of Low‑Carbohydrate Versus Mediterranean Diets on Glycemic Control and Cardiometabolic Risk in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Background:
Nutrition therapy remains a cornerstone of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management, yet the optimal dietary pattern for long‑term glycemic control and cardiovascular risk reduction remains debated. This study compared the effects of a low‑carbohydrate diet (LCD) and a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on glycemic parameters, lipid profile, and inflammatory biomarkers over 12 months in adults with T2DM.

Methods:
This open‑label, parallel‑group, randomized controlled trial was conducted at two university-affiliated hospitals in Denmark between March 2023 and June 2025. Adults aged 35–75 years with T2DM (HbA1c 7.0–10.0%) treated with oral hypoglycemic agents were randomized 1:1 to either an LCD (<40% energy from carbohydrates, 30% from fat) or a MedDiet (40–45% carbohydrates, 35–40% monounsaturated fats). Both groups received individualized counseling from registered dietitians and caloric intake matched to maintain weight stability. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included fasting glucose, lipid profile, body weight, high‑sensitivity C‑reactive protein (hs‑CRP), blood pressure, and treatment adherence. Analyses followed the intention‑to‑treat principle using mixed‑effects linear regression models.

Results:
A total of 340 participants were enrolled (mean age 58.2 ± 9.6 years; 52% female). At 12 months, both diets significantly reduced HbA1c from baseline, with greater improvement in the LCD group (–1.1%, 95% CI –1.3 to –0.9) than in the MedDiet group (–0.8%, 95% CI –1.0 to –0.6; between‑group difference –0.3%, p = 0.02). The LCD group also showed larger reductions in fasting glucose (–1.7 mmol/L vs. –1.2 mmol/L; p = 0.04) and triglycerides (–0.42 mmol/L vs. –0.25 mmol/L; p = 0.03). Conversely, the MedDiet led to greater increases in HDL cholesterol (+0.13 mmol/L vs. +0.07 mmol/L; p = 0.04) and a more pronounced reduction in hs‑CRP (–1.4 mg/L vs. –0.9 mg/L; p = 0.02). No major differences were observed in weight or blood pressure. Adherence rates were similar (LCD 80%, MedDiet 83%), and no serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusions:
Both the low‑carbohydrate and Mediterranean diets improved glycemic control and cardiometabolic markers in adults with type 2 diabetes. The LCD produced superior glycemic and triglyceride reductions, while the MedDiet favored lipid and inflammatory profiles. These findings suggest that individualized dietary approaches may optimize metabolic outcomes based on patient preference and clinical priorities.
