Title: Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on Blood Pressure and Psychosocial Well‑Being in Adults With Stage 1 Hypertension: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Background:
Lifestyle and behavioral interventions are critical for managing stage 1 hypertension, yet psychological stress often undermines adherence and blood pressure control. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) programs have shown promise in reducing stress and improving cardiovascular outcomes, but evidence from large clinical trials remains limited. This study investigated the effects of an 8-week MBSR program on blood pressure, perceived stress, and quality of life in adults with stage 1 hypertension.

Methods:
A parallel-group, single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted at two university-affiliated hospitals in Copenhagen between June 2023 and April 2025. Adults aged 35–70 years with untreated stage 1 hypertension (systolic 130–139 mmHg or diastolic 80–89 mmHg) were randomly assigned (1:1) to either an 8-week MBSR program (intervention) or an active lifestyle education control group. The MBSR program included weekly group sessions and home meditation practice. The primary outcome was change in mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included diastolic blood pressure (DBP), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS‑10), and health-related quality of life (SF‑36). Analyses were performed on an intention‑to‑treat basis using mixed-effects regression models.

Results:
Of 228 randomized participants (mean age 52.6 ± 8.7 years; 54% female), 211 completed the study. At 8 weeks, the MBSR group showed a significantly greater mean reduction in SBP (–6.8 mmHg; 95% CI: –9.5 to –4.1) compared with controls (–2.1 mmHg; 95% CI: –4.3 to 0.1; p = 0.002). DBP decreased by –4.2 mmHg vs. –1.3 mmHg (p = 0.01). The MBSR group also exhibited lower PSS‑10 scores (mean difference –4.6 points; p < 0.001) and improved SF‑36 mental health subscale scores (+7.9 points; p = 0.004). No adverse events were reported.

Conclusions:
An 8-week MBSR program significantly reduced blood pressure and perceived stress while enhancing mental quality of life in adults with stage 1 hypertension. These findings suggest that integrating structured mindfulness interventions into hypertension management may provide meaningful nonpharmacologic benefits. Further research should explore long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes.
