Title: Effect of a Personalized Mobile App–Based Weight Management Program on Glycemic Control in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract:

Background: Digital health interventions have the potential to improve self-management and glycemic outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, evidence on the real-world effectiveness of personalized, app-based weight management programs remains limited. This study evaluated the efficacy of a mobile health application providing individualized nutrition and activity feedback on glycemic control and weight loss in adults with T2DM.

Methods: In a 24-week, multicenter, parallel-group randomized controlled trial, 420 adults with T2DM (mean age 55 ± 9 years; 49% female; baseline HbA1c 8.1% ± 0.7%) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either the personalized mobile app–based program (intervention) or standard diabetes self-management education (control). The intervention integrated continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data with dietary and physical activity tracking, delivering tailored recommendations via an AI-driven algorithm. The primary outcome was mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. Secondary outcomes included changes in fasting plasma glucose, body weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, and patient-reported quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). Adherence, user engagement, and adverse events were also assessed.

Results: Of 420 randomized participants, 402 completed the study (95.7% retention). HbA1c decreased by −1.1% (95% CI −1.3 to −0.9) in the intervention group versus −0.5% (95% CI −0.7 to −0.3) in the control (between-group difference −0.6%; 95% CI −0.8 to −0.4; p < 0.001). Mean body weight reduction was −5.8 kg in the intervention group compared with −2.1 kg in controls (p < 0.001). Fasting glucose, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure also improved significantly (all p < 0.05). Quality-of-life scores increased by 9.2 points vs 4.1 points in controls (p = 0.01). App engagement correlated strongly with greater HbA1c reduction (r = 0.46, p < 0.001). No severe hypoglycemia or adverse effects were reported.

Conclusion: Use of a personalized mobile app integrating continuous glucose data and lifestyle feedback produced clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control, weight, and cardiometabolic parameters compared with standard education alone. These findings support the inclusion of adaptive digital tools in routine diabetes management to enhance patient engagement and metabolic outcomes.
