Title: Effect of a Mediterranean Diet Intervention on Cognitive Decline in Older Adults at Risk for Dementia: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract:

Background: Dietary factors play a critical role in cognitive aging and risk modification for neurodegenerative diseases. The Mediterranean diet, rich in polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants, has been linked to improved cognitive outcomes, yet prospective randomized data remain limited. This study examined the effect of adherence to a structured Mediterranean diet on cognitive trajectories and metabolic markers in older adults at risk of dementia.

Methods: In this 18-month, multicenter, randomized controlled trial conducted across four Danish primary care centers, 512 participants aged 60–80 years with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a calorie-neutral Mediterranean diet intervention (MedDiet; n = 256) guided by a registered dietitian or standard healthy eating advice (control; n = 256). The primary outcome was change in global cognition as measured by the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). Secondary outcomes included changes in working memory (Digit Span Test), executive function (Trail Making Test B), fasting glucose, lipid profile, and systemic inflammation (CRP and IL-6). Adherence was monitored via dietary logs and plasma carotenoid levels.

Results: A total of 490 participants (95.7%) completed the trial. At 18 months, the MedDiet group showed significantly less cognitive decline versus controls (mean ADAS-Cog change + 0.8 ± 3.7 vs + 2.4 ± 4.0; between-group difference − 1.6; 95% CI − 2.3 to − 0.9; p < 0.001). Significant improvements were also observed in executive function (− 23.4 s vs − 9.6 s; p = 0.002) and fasting glucose (− 0.6 mmol/L vs − 0.1 mmol/L; p = 0.01). Participants adhering to the MedDiet experienced greater reductions in CRP (− 1.8 mg/L vs − 0.7 mg/L; p = 0.005) and IL-6 (− 0.9 pg/mL vs − 0.2 pg/mL; p = 0.01). Plasma carotenoid levels increased by 38% from baseline (p < 0.001), confirming dietary adherence. No adverse events were attributed to the intervention.

Conclusion: Adherence to a Mediterranean diet for 18 months significantly slowed cognitive decline and improved metabolic and inflammatory profiles in older adults at risk for dementia. These findings reinforce the role of dietary modification as a viable non-pharmacological strategy for cognitive preservation in aging populations.
