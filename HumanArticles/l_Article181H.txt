Introduction: The epidemiology of diseases allows the generation of preventive measures, for the modification of their natural evolution or to prevent their appearance. In second-level hospitals of care, most of the pathologies of each medical specialty are treated. Therefore, knowing the main reasons for external consultation in orthopedics and their seasonal predominance is a tool for implementing strategies for the benefit of patients.

Material and methods: Observational study carried out with the patient population of the external orthopedic consultation service of a second-level hospital of care, from January to December 2017. Patients over the age of 18 who first attended consultation were included.

Results: 11,704 consultations granted in the period, 7,862 (67.17%) women and 3,842 (32.82%) men. The average age of patients was 51.84 ± 0.14. The most common cause of consultation was arthropathies (47.65%). During the autumn, the largest number of consultations (32.33) were granted.

Conclusions: Arthropathies, specifically gonarthrosis, were the main reason for external consultation, accounting for nearly half of the consultations granted. It is transcendental to identify the modifiable risk factors of these pathologies with the aim of reducing the negative impact it generates at the functional, economic and quality of life level. Clinical relevance: Further epidemiological studies on orthopedic pathologies will improve preventive strategies and optimize resources to improve patient care.
