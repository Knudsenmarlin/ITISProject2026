Introduction: It has been suggested that neuromuscular blockade (NMB) affects the capacity of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring to measure consciousness in sedated children. Our aim was to analyse the impact of NMB on BIS values in critically ill children.

Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of children monitored with a BIS system that received a continuous infusion of vecuronium. We analysed data on clinical, diagnostic and haemodynamic variables, sedatives, analgesics, muscle relaxants, and BIS parameters. We compared BIS parameters before the use of a muscle relaxant, during its administration, before its discontinuation and for the 24h following the end of the infusion.

Results: The analysis included 35 patients (median age, 30 months). The most common diagnosis was heart disease (85%). The most frequent indication for initiation of NMB was low cardiac output (45%), followed by adaptation to mechanical ventilation (20%). Neuromuscular blockade did not produce a significant change in BIS values. We found a decrease was observed in electromyography (EMG) values at 6h (34.9±9.4 vs 31.2±7; P=.008) and 12h after initiation of NMB (34.9±9.4 vs 28.6±4.8; P =.006). We observed a small significant increase in BIS after discontinuation of NMB (from 42.7±11 to 48.4±14.5, P=.001), and 6 and 12h later (51.3±16.6; P=.015). There were no differences in the doses of sedatives or analgesics except for fentanyl, of which the dose was lowered after discontinuation of vecuronium.

Conclusion: Continuous NMB produces small changes on BIS values that are not clinically significant and therefore does not interfere with BIS consciousness monitoring in critically ill children.
