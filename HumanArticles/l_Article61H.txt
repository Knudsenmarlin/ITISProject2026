Objectives: Adhesive capsulitis results in a multidimensional disability which demands a polygonal approach. Although physiotherapy proves an essential for a complete and comprehensive recovery in adhesive capsulitis, evidence also suggest the role of yoga in the management, hence this study investigate their effectiveness.

Methods: This is a quasi-randomised control study. A pre-diagnosed subacute and chronic adhesive capsulitis of shoulder, between the age group of 35-60 years of both genders of total 40 participants were randomly divided into Group 'A' (yogasana) and Group 'B' (physiotherapy). The parameters of pain, joint mobility and functional disabilities were measured at the baseline and after four-weeks.

Results: The mean age of Group 'A' was 45.4 ± 7.78 years whereas 50.05 ± 5.98 years was in Group 'B'. Intragroup analysis for both the groups showed statistically significant improvement in all the study variables. Whereas in intergroup analysis yogasana was found to be statistically significant in improving shoulder abduction mobility, p=0.03, effect size r=0.35 and also in shoulder flexion (p=0.15, r=0.23) and shoulder internal rotation (p=0.07, r=0.3), though statistically not significant, in view of small effect size response.

Conclusions: Both techniques improved the functional status in adhesive capsulitis, however additional effects on joint mobility was demonstrated by yogasana.
