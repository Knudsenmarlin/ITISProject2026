Background and aim: Vascular calcification is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality in end stage renal disease, and particularly in hemodialysis patients. Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with vascular calcification among this category of patients. Cholecalciferol or vitamin D3; the native inactivated 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D], has been proposed to have a good impact on vascular calcification and vitamin D deficiency. However, clinical data is still limited.

Methods and results: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was carried out to evaluate the effect of oral cholecalciferol on vascular calcification and 25(OH)D levels in hemodialysis patients. A total of sixty eligible hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (Oral 200.000IU Cholecalciferol per month) or a placebo group, for 3 months. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23), osteoprotegerin (OPG), calcium, phosphorus, their product (CaXP) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, were all assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT03602430. Cholecalciferol significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH)D and fetuin-A in the treatment group (p-value < 0.001), while no significant difference was observed in the placebo group. Cholecalciferol administration showed no effect on either FGF-23 or OPG. None of the treatment group patients experienced any adverse effects.

Conclusion: Cholecalciferol was shown to be an effective, tolerable, inexpensive pharmacotherapeutic option to overcome vitamin D deficiency, with a possible modulating effect on fetuin-A, among hemodialysis patients. CLINICALTRIALS.
