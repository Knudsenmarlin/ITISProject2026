Objective: To investigate the effect of biofeedback and electrical stimulation combined with prostate massage on chronic prostatitis /chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS).

Methods: A total of 76 cases of diagnosed CP/CPPS were randomly divided into groups A (n = 20), treated by prostatic massage twice a week, B (n = 20), treated by biofeedback and electrical stimulation 5 times a week, and C (n = 20) treated by biofeedback and electrical stimulation 5 times a week combined with prostatic massage twice a week, all for 14 days. Another 16 cases were included in group D as controls left untreated. NIH-CPSI scores were obtained before and at 30 days after treatment and compared among different groups of the patients.

Results: Compared with the baseline, the patients in groups A, B and C showed significant decreases after treatment in the NIH-CPSI scores for pain (［13.55 ± 2.37］ vs ［10.85 ± 2.28］, ［13.40 ± 2.28］ vs ［10.60 ± 2.23］, and ［13.70 ± 3.42］ vs ［8.65 ± 1.69］), urinary symptoms (［5.50 ± 1.43］ vs ［3.65 ± 1.27］, ［5.65 ± 1.31］ vs ［3.95 ± 1.28］, and ［5.40 ± 1.35］ vs ［2.95 ± 1.28］), quality of life (［8.70 ± 1.81］ vs ［6.90 ± 1.71］, ［8.90 ± 1.12］ vs ［5.80 ± 1.85］, and ［8.95 ± 1.47］ vs ［4.35 ± 1.53］) and the total NIH-CPSI scores (［27.75 ± 2.65］ vs ［21.40 ± 3.03］, ［27.95 ± 3.24］ vs ［20.35 ± 3.95］, and ［28.05 ± 3.78］ vs ［15.95 ± 2.41］) (P < 0.05). Even more remarkable reduction was observed in the total NIH-CPSI scores in group C than in A and B (P < 0.05), but with no statistically significant difference between groups A and B (P > 0.05) or in the control group before and after the treatment (P > 0.05).

Conclusions: Biofeedback and electrical stimulation combined with prostate massage has a synergistic effect on CP/CPPS by alleviating pain and urinary symptoms and improving the quality of life.
