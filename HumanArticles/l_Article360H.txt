Background: We evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of nimotuzumab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.

Patients and methods: In this multicenter, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial conducted in Japan (JapicCTI-090825), patients received thoracic radiotherapy (60 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction, 6 weeks) and four 4-week cycles of chemotherapy (day 1, cisplatin 80 mg/m2; days 1 and 8, vinorelbine 20 mg/m2). Nimotuzumab 200 mg was administrated weekly for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was treatment completion rate, defined as the percentage of patients completing 60 Gy of radiotherapy within 8 weeks, 2 cycles of chemotherapy, and at least 75% of the required nimotuzumab dose during the initial 2-cycle concurrent chemoradiotherapy period.

Results: Of 40 patients enrolled, 39 received the study treatment, which was well tolerated, with a completion rate of 87.2%. Thirty-eight patients completed 60 Gy of radiotherapy within 8 weeks. Infusion reaction, grade 3 or higher rash, grade 3 or higher radiation pneumonitis, or grade 4 or higher nonhematologic toxicity were not observed. The objective response rate was 69.2%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and 5-year PFS rate were 508 days and 29.0%, respectively. The 5-year PFS rate in patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma (n = 23) was 13.7% and in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (n = 16) was 50.0%. The 5-year overall survival rate was 58.4%.

Conclusion: Addition of nimotuzumab to the concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen was well tolerated and showed potential for treating patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma.
