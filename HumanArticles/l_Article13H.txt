Background: Tai-Chi is a popular form of mind-body activity that is suitable for people of all ages. Accumulating evidence have shown that Tai-Chi can help ameliorate cardiovascular diseases. However, the benefits of long-term practice of Tai-Chi on blood pressure control remains unclear. A total of 898 villagers of Chenjiagou were enrolled in this study based on certain inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Methods: All basic information and clinical data were collected by physicians. The effects of Tai-Chi on the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mental status of participants were analyzed. The average practice time of Tai-Chi in the Tai-Chi group was 28.53 years (median 29 years, range 2-69 years).

Results: The results showed that SBP and DBP were significantly lower in the Tai-Chi group, compared with the control group and the stop group. Meanwhile, the long-term practice of Tai-Chi significantly improved the body mass index (BMI) (P=0.021). Stepwise regression results demonstrated that Tai-Chi practice, age and BMI could significantly affect blood pressure, with adjusted R2 of 0.218 and 0.159 for SBP and DBP, respectively. In addition, Tai-chi is associated with a lower rate of hypertension after age 40. However, compared with the control group, participants who practiced Tai-Chi for a short time, then stopped, showed no significant improvement in the above-mentioned measurements.

Conclusions: The long-term practice of Tai-Chi was associated with better blood pressure, at least partly through the improvement of BMI and mental state. However, the short-term practice of Tai-Chi may not provide significant benefits on blood pressure in the long term.
