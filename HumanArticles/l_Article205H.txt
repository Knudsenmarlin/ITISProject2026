Background: Tuberculosis remains an important cause of chronic constrictive pericarditis (CCP) in developing countries. It is a surgically treatable cause of diastolic heart failure. Without surgery, it is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of clinical presentations and perioperative outcomes of pericardiectomy in all patients operated from July 2015 to December 2018 for tuberculous CCP.

Results: A total 14 patients (mean age - 38 ± 13.3 years, 10 male), underwent pericardiectomy via median sternotomy without cardiopulmonary bypass. Eleven patients (79%) had completed treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, and three (21%) were on anti-tubercular treatment at the time of referral for surgery. Ten patients (71%) had prior hospitalisation for cardiac failure. At the time of surgery, eight patients (57%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV. The median duration of symptoms before surgical intervention was 15 months (range 11-24 months). Three patients (21%) had associated cardiac cirrhosis. Twelve patients (86%) underwent total pericardiectomy. Two patients (14%) underwent partial pericardiectomy. The mean operative time was 160 ± 33.8 minutes. The mean central venous press pressure before and after surgery were 28 ± 3.9 and 10 ± 2 mmHg respectively. The mean intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays were 4 ± 1.5 and 10 ± 2 days respectively. There was one (7%) 30-day mortality. There were two deaths (14%) due to non-cardiac causes at 10 and 16 months respectively. The remaining 11 patients (79%) are doing well (mean follow-up- 23 months), and are in NYHA class I.

Conclusions: Tuberculosis is the most common cause of CCP in our region. Pericardiectomy provides definitive treatment to alleviate symptoms resolution and improve survival.
