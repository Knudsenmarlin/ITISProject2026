Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) supplementation on oxidative stress engendered from hypoxia in population live at high altitude.

Methods: This is an intervention study in which 50 females of volunteers population-36 of them who live at high altitude compared with the placebo group (14 from the total population that live at sea level). Blood samples were collected in -anticoagulant tubes from control and high altitude before and after CoQ10 supplementation (150 mg/day for 2, 4 and 8 weeks). Plasma was separated and used for the determination of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NOx), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), paraoxonase (PON1) by spectrophotometer, CoQ10 and vitamin E by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Results: Our results appeared that TAC, PON1, vitamin E and CoQ10 concentrations were significantly decreased in population at high altitude at base line compared to placebo group population at sea level. Whereas, administration of CoQ10 attenuated all measured parameters especially after eight weeks of administration.

Conclusion: We concluded that coenzyme Q10 supplement at a dose of 150 mg/day has a powerful effect in oxidative stress parameters and increased antioxidant parameters included vitamin E in population with hypoxia after 4 and 8 weeks. So that supplementation positively affects oxidative stress and is recommended CoQ10 supplementation in population who live at high altitude.
