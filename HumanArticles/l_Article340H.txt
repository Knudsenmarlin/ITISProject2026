Immunosuppressive drugs are widely used to treat several autoimmune disorders and prevent rejection after organ transplantation. However, intra-individual variations in the pharmacological response to immunosuppressive therapy critically influence its efficacy, often resulting in poor treatment responses and serious side effects. Effective diagnostic tools that help clinicians to tailor immunosuppressive therapy to the needs and immunological profile of the individual patient thus constitute a major unmet clinical need. In vitro assays that measure immune cell responses to immunosuppressive drugs constitute a promising approach to individualized immunosuppressive therapy. Here, we present the Immunobiogram, a functional pharmacodynamic immune cell-based assay for simultaneous quantitative measurement of a patient's immune response to a battery of immunosuppressive drugs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from patients are immunologically stimulated to induce activation and proliferation and embedded in a hydrogel mixture in which they are exposed to a concentration gradient of the immunosuppressants of interest. Analysis of samples from kidney transplant patients using this procedure revealed an association between the sensitivity of individual patients to the immunosuppressive regimen and their immunological risk of transplant rejection. Incorporation of the Immunobiogram assay into clinical settings could greatly facilitate personalized optimization and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy, and study of the mechanisms underlying resistance to immunosuppressants.
