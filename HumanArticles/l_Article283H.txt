Aim: Effective intervention is necessary for improving the social functioning of patients with severe mental illness (SMI). We examined the effects of home-visit occupational therapy (OT) using a Management Tool for Daily Life Performance (MTDLP) that was designed to support patients in completing their desired daily life activities. The control group were treated by home-visit OT without using MTDLP.

Method: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, 60 participants included adults aged 18-65 with an ICD-10 diagnosis of F2 (i.e., schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders) or F3 (i.e., mood [affective] disorders) and who utilized one of the 20 psychiatric outreach teams in Japan. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups: MTDLP (n = 29), control (n = 31). Home-visit OT was provided to both groups, once a week, for four months. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to compare changes in participants' social functioning using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and the Social Functioning Scale (SFS).

Results: The GAF scores of the MTDLP group improved significantly greater than those of the control group. No significant change in SFS total scores was found between the groups; however, the Employment/Occupation scores (an SFS subscale) of the MTDLP group significantly improved compared to the controls.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that MTDLP can increase the social functioning of people with SMI more so than controls. Thus, home-visit OT using MTDLP that is intensively focused on the patient's desires and implemented in the real-world environment appears to contribute to improvements in social functioning.
