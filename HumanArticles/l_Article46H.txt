Background: Within the operating rooms (ORs), distractions occur on a regular basis, which affect the surgical workflow and results in the interruption of urgent tasks. This study aimed to observe the occurrence of intraoperative distractions in Tunisian ORs and evaluate associations among distractions, teamwork, workload, and stress.

Methods: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted in four different ORs (orthopedic, urology, emergency, and digestive surgery) of Sahloul University Hospital for a period of 3 mo in 2018. Distractions and teamwork were recorded and rated in real time during the intraoperative phase of each case using validated observation sheets. Besides, at the end of each operation, stress and workload of team members were measured.

Results: Altogether, 50 cases were observed and 160 participants were included. Distractions happened in 100% of the included operations. Overall, we recorded 933 distractions that occurred once every 3 min, with a mean frequency of M = 18.66 (standard deviation [SD] = 8.24) per case. It is particularly noticeable that procedural distractions occurred significantly higher during teaching cases compared with nonteaching cases (M = 3.85, M = 0.60, respectively, P < 0.001). The mean global teamwork score was M = 3.85 (SD = 0.67), the mean workload score was M = 58.60 (SD = 24.27), and the mean stress score was M = 15.29 (SD = 4.00). Furthermore, a higher stress level among surgeons was associated with distractions related to equipment failures and people entering or exiting the OR (r = 0.206, P < 0.01 and r = 0.137, P < 0.01, respectively). Similarly, nurses reported a higher workload in the presence of distractions related to the work environment in the OR (r = 0.313, P < 0.05).

Conclusions: This study highlighted a serious problem, which often team members seem to ignore or underestimate. Taking our findings into consideration, we recommend the implementation of the Surgical Checklist and preoperative briefings to reduce the number of surgical distractions. Also, a continuous teamwork training should be adopted to ensure that OR staff can avoid or handle distractions when they happen.
