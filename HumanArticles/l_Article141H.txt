The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Prolonged Exposure (DBT PE) protocol improves DBT's effects on PTSD in research settings, but its effectiveness in community settings is largely unknown. This pilot nonrandomized controlled trial examined DBT with and without DBT PE in four public mental health agencies. Patients (N = 35, 12-56 years old, 80.0% female, 64.7% racial/ethnic minorities, 44.1% sexual minorities) had PTSD, were receiving DBT, and completed assessments every four months over one year. Sixteen patients (45.7%) initiated DBT PE, 19 (54.3%) did not, and dropout did not differ between groups (31.3% vs. 26.3%). The primary barrier to initiating DBT PE was clinician turnover (57.9% of non-initiators). After adjusting for confounds, DBT PE initiators (g = 1.1) and completers (g = 1.4) showed a greater reduction in PTSD than patients who received DBT only (g = 0.5; p's < .05). Rates of reliable improvement in PTSD were 71.4% (DBT PE completers), 53.8% (DBT PE initiators), and 31.3% (DBT). Similar patterns were observed for posttraumatic cognitions, emotion dysregulation, general psychological distress, and limited activity days. There was no worsening of self-injurious behavior or crisis service use among patients who received DBT PE. Benchmarking analyses indicated comparable feasibility, acceptability, and safety, but a smaller magnitude of clinical change, than in efficacy studies. Results require replication in a randomized trial but suggest that DBT PE can be transported effectively to community settings.
