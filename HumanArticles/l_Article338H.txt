The addition of essential oil (EO) as chitosan encapsulated can increase the efficiency of these oils in broiler feeding. Therefore, the objective of the current research was to explore the antibacterial and antioxidant potential of garlic essential oil (GEO) (free vs. nanoencapsulated) and their effects on performance, gene expression of mucin2, microbial, and morphology of intestine in broilers. A total of 900 1-day-old male broilers (Ross 308) were assigned to six dietary treatments (0, 100, and 200 mg/kg free GEO and 0 (contain of chitosan), 100 and 200 mg/kg nanoencapsulated GEO) with a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement based on completely randomized design. Garlic essential oil encapsulation with chitosan significantly enhanced antibacterial and antioxidant parameters. At 100 mg/kg nanoencapsulated GEO had significant (P < 0.01) advantages in improving BW gain (BWG) (22-42 and 0-42) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) (0-42). Maximum feed intake (FI) was also associated with the control group (P < 0.05). Broilers fed on 100 mg/kg of nanoencapsulated GEO showed higher villi length and width relative to other treatments and villi length to crypt depth ratio as well (P < 0.01). The nanoencapsulation process of GEO (P < 0.01) affected the Lactobacilli population in the digesta of ileo-caecum and mucin2 gene expression. In broiler chickens, the tested EO, especially nanoencapsulated type, enhanced more evaluated parameters. Because of its ideal properties, nanoencasulating with chitosan may also be an effective and inexpensive way to protect bioactive compounds and improve GEO effects in broiler chickens.
