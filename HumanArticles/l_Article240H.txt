Introduction: Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a common and often long-standing musculoskeletal condition. Evidence of the effectiveness of interventions addressing soft tissue flexibility is conflicting and of inconsistent scientific quality. However, reduced soft tissue flexibility can negatively affect patellofemoral joint kinematics. Lower limb range of motion (LLROM) reflects soft tissue flexibility throughout the kinetic chain. The aim was to evaluate the short-term effectiveness of an intervention targeting LLROM on pain and disability in patients with PFP.

Methods: A randomized, non-concurrent, multiple-baseline single-case design with a two-week intervention phase and baseline and postintervention phase with varying length was conducted. Eight participants (5 females, 3 males) of age 19(±1.6) years, weekly sports participation 12(±3.1) hours and 17(±14) months symptom duration were included. The Anterior Knee Pain Scale - Dutch Version (AKPS-DV) and the Patient Specific Complaint Scale (PSCS) were administered twice a week. After allocating participants to one of four subgroups of reduced LLROM the intervention was applied. The intervention consisted of soft tissue techniques (mobilization, taping, and stretching).

Results: Participant 3 and 6 showed a medium and small but statistically significant positive effect on the AKPS-DV. Participant 2 showed a large and statistically significant positive effect on the PSCS.

Conclusions: This study provides moderate evidence that an intervention targeting LLROM in patients with PFP reduces pain and disability in the short-term. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and optimize individual treatment outcomes.
