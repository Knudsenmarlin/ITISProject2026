Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of topical curcumin and topical triamcinolone acetonide in a professional population with minor aphthous ulcers by assessing six clinical variables: site, size, pain, healing period, frequency of recurrence and number of ulcers.

Materials and methods: This randomized, parallel designed pilot trial was performed on 60 symptomatic individuals with minor aphthous ulcer. Willing participants were allocated randomly into group I and group II. Participants in group I were treated with topical curcumin and group II were treated with topical triamcinolone acetonide for a period of 6 months. All participants were blinded to the drug they received. Participants were assessed on day 1, day 3, day 5, day 7, and after healing for symptomatic reduction in pain, size, healing period, frequency of recurrence, and in the number of ulcers. Statistically, independent sample t test, Chi-square test, and Log rank Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were performed.

Results: Lower labial mucosa was found to be the predominant site of minor aphthous ulcer in both the groups. A gradual reduction in pain and size was noted in both the groups with statistical significance of p value <0.001. All the ulcers in both the groups healed completely without scarring within 2 weeks with statistical significance. In both the treatment groups, new ulcers occurred throughout the follow-up period of 6 months. The mean number of the ulcers are statistically not significant with p value >0.05.

Conclusion: Our study showed clinically beneficial effects with topical curcumin with regard to ulcer size, pain, healing, and recurrence rate. Also topical curcumin gel was well tolerated and performed ot par with topical triamcinolone acetonide oral paste with a borderline favorable result with triamcinolone.
