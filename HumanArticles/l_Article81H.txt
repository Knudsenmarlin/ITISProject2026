This article investigated the clinical effects of piracetam with nimodipine in the treatment of vascular dementia (VD) after cerebral infarction. 98 patients with vascular dementia after cerebral infarction were selected and divided into the control group and the study group according to the treatment method. The control group was treated with nimodipine alone. The study group was treated with piracetam on the basis of this observation, and we test the ADL (life ability score), MoCA(montreal cognitive assessment scale), ADAS-Cog(alzheimer's scale-cognition), MMSE(mental status examination) scores and quality of life scores before and after treatment in the two groups. Before treatment, there were no significant differences in ADL, MoCA, and ADAS-Cog scores between the two groups (P>0.05). After treatment, the ADL, MoCA, and ADAS-Cog scores of the study group were superior to the control group. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in MMSE scores between the two groups before treatment and 1 month after treatment (P>0.05). The MMSE scores of the study group were better than the control group after 3 months of treatment and half a year after treatment. The difference was statistically significant (P <0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in the quality of life scores between the two groups (P>0.05). After treatment, the quality of life scores was significantly higher than the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). For patients with vascular dementia after cerebral infarction, piracetam combined with nimodipine can improve the cognitive function, improve the quality of life, and have a significant clinical effect.
