Abstract
Objective: The current study tested an expressive writing intervention aimed at reducing alcohol use and sexual risk behavior among college women that consume alcohol. Methods: A 2 X 2 mixed between- within-subjects experimental design was utilized to test the effect of expressive writing on alcohol use and sexual risk behavior over time among college women that drink. Study participants completed baseline assessments of alcohol use and sexual risk behavior and were randomly assigned to either a control writing condition (first day of college) or an expressive writing condition (negative alcohol-related event). Participants completed baseline assessments 30 days later. Data for this study were collected in the Fall 2017 semester. Results: A significant interaction effect was found for writing condition over time on sexual risk behavior. Conclusion: Findings provide preliminary support for the use of expressive writing as mechanism to reduce sexual risk behavior among college women that consume alcohol.
