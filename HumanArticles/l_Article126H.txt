This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of two types of high-fiber biscuits on the lipid and anthropometric profile of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). This study involved a pre- and posttest randomized controlled trial design conducted on 33 subjects of the first first group given caromma biscuit (made from modified cassava flour mixed with koro sword flour and date jam) and 31 subjects of the second first group given temma biscuit (made from a mixture of tempeh flour with date jam). Each group consumed 100 g of biscuit each day for 4 wk. The anthropometric data collected included body mass index (BMI), waist-hip circumference ratio (WHCR), body fat percentage (BFP), blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose (FBG). The lipid profile included total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride collected before and after the study. The two types of biscuits had similar nutritional contents in terms of energy, carbohydrate, and fat contents, and their glycemic indices were low. However, the fiber content of caromma was higher than that of temma. After 4 wk, the anthropometric profiles, such as BMI (24.47+5.62 to 24.56+5.55; p=0.008), BFP (32.18+6.83 to 32.68+7.22; p=0.4), and WHCR (0.85+0.67 to 0.86+0.65; p=0.015), were unchanged in the caromma and temma groups (BMI 26.68+3.82 to 26.75+3.92; p=0.072; BFP 35.96+5.34 to 35.90+5.15; p=0.907; WHCR 0.86+0.66 to 0.88+0.4; p=0.006), except reducing FBG (167.06+82.8 to 154.85+95.0; p=0.150 in the caromma group and 173.19+92.72 to 150.06+73.64; p=0.095 in the temma group). A significant improvement was observed in the lipid profile of the caromma group (cholesterol, 239.73+35.3 to 195.70+34.13, p=0.000; LDL, 145.18+29.89 to 122.24+29.00, p=0.000; HDL, 61.00+17.76 to 51.12+15.40, p=0.000; triglyceride 175.09+112.64 to 123.67+73.89, p=0.000) and temma group (cholesterol, 264.42+75.10 to 204.68+37.11, p=0.000; LDL, 154.97+53.59 to 125.45+30.56, p=0.001; HDL, 59.68+1,328 to 49.48+11.52, p=0.000; triglyceride, 226.00+172.56 to 152.48+99.88, p=0.007). Lipid and animal protein intake should be limited among patients with type 2 DM. A high lipid profile, which is dangerous for patients with type 2 DM, can be prevented. Originality: Caromma and temma biscuits can be consumed by patients with diabetes. Although these biscuits cannot improve the anthropometric profiles of the subjects, their consumption has positive effects on the blood lipid profile.
