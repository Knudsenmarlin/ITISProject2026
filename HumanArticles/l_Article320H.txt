Objective: To investigate the effect of Linshu Decoction (LSD) combined with levofloxacin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with type ⅢA prostatitis.

Methods: We randomly divided 124 type ⅢA prostatitis patients with lower urinary tract symptoms into an experimental and a control group, the former treated orally with LSD (1 dose bid) combined with levofloxacin tablets (0.1 g bid), and the latter with levofloxacin tablets only (0.1g bid). Before and after 4 weeks of medication, we obtained the NIH-CPSI, Traditional Chinese Medicine symptoms (TCM) scores, white blood cell (WBC) count in EPS and the results of uroflowmetry from the patients and compared them between the two groups.

Results: Finally 115 of the patients were included in this study. After 4 weeks of treatment, the patients of the experimental group, compared with the controls, showed significantly decreased NIH-CPSI (14.57 ± 3.87 vs 20.12 ± 3.45, P < 0.05), TCM scores (6.35 ± 1.27 vs 10.72 ± 1.72, P < 0.05) and WBC count in EPS (［7.35 ± 4.52］ vs ［9.87 ± 5.87］ n/HP, P < 0.05). In comparison with baseline, the maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and average urinary flow rate (Qave) were increased in both of the two groups after medication, with statistically significant difference only in the experimental group (P < 0.05).

Conclusions: Linshu Decoction combined with levofloxacin is more effective than levofloxacin alone in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with type ⅢA prostatitis.
