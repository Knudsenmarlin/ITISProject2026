Objectives: Vestibular nerve stimulation using the portable battery-operated vestibular nerve stimulator is a sophisticated method noninvasive, safe, and easy to operate. It was hypothesized that vestibular nerve stimulation is effective in the management of type 2 diabetes. Hence, the present study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of vestibular nerve stimulation using portable battery-operated vestibular nerve stimulator in the management of diabetes.

Methods: The present study was a double-blind randomized controlled trial with 1:1 split between the control and experimental groups. A total of 30 participants with type 2 diabetes were part of the study after obtaining the written informed consent. After recording the baseline values, the vestibular nerve stimulation was administered to the participants in the intervention group for 90 days. Sham stimulation was administered to the control group for 90 days. Outcome measures were recorded after 30 days and after 90 days of the intervention in both the groups.

Results: There was significant decrease in the total body weight, fasting, postprandial blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin levels, leptin, very low density lipoproteins levels followed by the intervention. There was significant improvement in both spatial and verbal memory scores. Depression and stress scores and systolic blood pressure decreased and remained in normal limits.

Conclusions: The study results have proven multimodal action of vestibular stimulation. It not only acts on regulation of the glucose metabolism but also can regulate the autonomic activity and improve cognition and relieve stress. This is the interesting finding of our study, which needs detailed further research to support implementation of vestibular nerve stimulation as an adjunctive therapy in the management of diabetes.
