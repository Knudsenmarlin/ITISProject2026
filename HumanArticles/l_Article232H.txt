Objectives: Our objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of humanoid robot-based distraction on reducing distress and pain in children undergoing intravenous insertion.

Methods: A two-arm, open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted April 2017-May 2018, in a pediatric emergency department (ED). A sample of 86 children aged 6-11 years who required intravenous insertion were recruited. Exclusion criteria included hearing/visual impairments, neurocognitive delay, sensory impairment to pain, previous enrollment, and ED clinical staff discretion. Outcome measures included the Observed Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised (OSBD-R) (distress) and the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) (pain).

Results: Of the 86 children recruited (median age 9 years, IQR 7,10); 55% (47/86) were male, 9% (7/82) were premature, 82% (67/82) had a previous ED visit, 31% (25/82) had a previous hospitalization and 78% (64/82) had previous intravenous insertion. Ninety-six percent (78/81) received topical anesthetic prior to intravenous insertion. Total OSBD-R distress score was 1.49 ± 2.36 (standard care) versus 0.78 ± 1.32 (robot) (p < 0.05). FPS-R pain score was 4 (IQR 2,6) (standard care) versus 2 (IQR 0,4) (robot) (p = 0.13). Parental anxiety immediately after the procedure was 36.7 (11.1) (standard care) versus 31.3 (8.5) (robot) (p = 0.04). Parents were more satisfied with pain management in the robotic distraction group (95% vs 72% very satisfied) (p = 0.002).

Conclusions: Humanoid robot-based distraction therapy is associated with a modest positive impact on child distress for pediatric intravenous insertion, but not pain. It can be considered a potential tool in the ED toolkit for procedural pain-associated distress reduction.
