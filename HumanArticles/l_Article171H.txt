Objective: The optimal steroid regimen in the treatment of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is controversial. This study aims to compare low- and high-dose steroid regimens in the treatment of SAT.

Methods: A single-center, retrospective observational cohort study with up to 1 year of follow-up was conducted. A total of 44 patients in the 16-mg methylprednisolone (MPS) group and 47 patients in the 48-mg MPS group were enrolled. Clinical and laboratory findings from the time of diagnosis to 1-year of the follow-up were assessed. Treatment response, recurrence, and hypothyroidism (HPT) rates were evaluated.

Results: Clinical symptoms, sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein, and thyroid hormone levels of the patients were similar in the 2 groups. Recovery was achieved in all patients at the end of the treatments; however, treatment duration needed to be extended for 6 (13.6%) and 1 (2.1%) of the patients in the 16-mg and 48-mg MPS groups, respectively. The 48-mg MPS group had a higher SAT recurrence rate than the 16-mg MPS group (P = .04). Logistic regression analysis suggested that a lower thyroid-stimulating hormone level at the end of the treatment was a predictor of recurrence (β = -0.544, P = .014, 95% CI: 0.376-0.895). While the transient HPT rate was 10 (21.3%) and 10 (22.7%) in the 48-mg and 16-mg MPS groups, respectively, a permanent HPT developed in 5 (10.6%) of patients in the 48-mg MPS and 3 (6.8%) in the 16-mg MPS group. The permanent and transient HPT rates were determined to be similar in the low- and high-dose groups (P > .05).

Conclusion: Low-dose steroid therapy may be sufficient to achieve a complete recovery and better outcomes in SAT.
