Objectives: To compare the effect of Iberet Folic® and Zincofer® on haemoglobin (Hb) and serum ferritin level; and its adverse effect.

Methods: This randomised controlled trial conducted from January 2018 until December 2018. Pregnant women below 34 weeks of gestation, with Hb concentration less than 11 g/dL and serum ferritin level less than 12 ug/L were randomised to receive either one tablet Zincofer® or one tablet Iberet Folate® daily for four weeks. Both groups were compared in terms of effect on Hb level, serum ferritin level, and other haematological indices adverse effect related to treatment, and treatment cost.

Results: Hundred and thirty patients were recruited in this study with 68 patients in Iberet Folic group and 62 patients in Zincofer group. The change in the Hb and serum ferritin level from baseline to day 30 did not differ significantly between treatment groups. The mean (±SD) change from baseline to day 30 was 2.15 (±0.59) g/dL in the Iberet Folic group, and 1.98 (±0.49) in the Zincofer (p value = 0.08). Mean serum ferritin at day 30 was 17.2 (±3.68) ug/L and 16.7 (±4.28) ug/L with 8.44 (±3.41) and 8.55 (±3.50) difference, respectively (p = 0.86). Adverse events were comparable in between groups, with p value >0.05. GI intolerance and constipation were among the common side effects, occurred in 34.6 and 29.2% cases, respectively.

Conclusions: Zincofer® offers equivalent efficacy and side effect profile in comparison with Iberet Folic® for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) during pregnancy, but with lower cost.
