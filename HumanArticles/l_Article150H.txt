Background and aims: During aerobic physical activity (PA), hypoglycemia is common in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Few studies have compared the effectiveness of different carbohydrate (CHO) intake strategies to prevent PA-induced hypoglycemia. Our objective was to compare the efficacy of two CHO intake strategies, same total amount but different CHO intake timing, to maintain glucose levels in the target range (4.0-10.0 mmol/L) during PA in people with T1D.

Methods and results: An open-label, randomized, crossover study in 33 participants (21 adults; 12 adolescents). Participants practiced 60 min PA sessions (ergocyle) at 60% VO2peak 3.5 h after lunch comparing an intake of 0.5 g of CHO per kg of body weight applied in a pre-PA single CHO intake (SCI) or in a distributed CHO intake (DCI) before and during PA. The percentage of time spent in glucose level target range during PA was not different between the two strategies (SCI: 75 ± 35%; DCI: 87 ± 26%; P = 0.12). Hypoglycemia (<4.0 mmol/L) occurred in 4 participants (12%) with SCI compared to 6 participants (18%) with DCI (P = 0.42). The SCI strategy led to a higher increase (P = 0.01) and variability of glucose levels (P = 0.04) compared with DCI.

Conclusions: In people living with T1D, for a 60 min moderate aerobic PA in the post-absorptive condition, a 0.5 g/kg CHO intake helped most participants maintain acceptable glycemic control with both strategies. No clinically significant difference was observed between the SCI and DCI strategies. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03214107 (July 11, 2017).
