Objective: To compare and contrast clinical diagnoses with autopsy findings in order to identify unexpected, relevant discrepancies.

Material and method: A retrospective observational study of the revision of autopsies of adults and their respective medical records in order to classify them according to referral department and Goldman's classification was carried out at the Central University Hospital of Asturias between 2008-2017.

Results: 694 (52.6%) of 1320 autopsies were included in the study. Discrepancies were observed in 57.6% of cases, although the majority (39.3%) were minor. Type I discrepancies were identified in 63 autopsies (9.1%); malignant neoplasms being the main pathology observed (57.1%), mainly of gastrointestinal origin (about 28%). The second most common discrepancy was found in cases of infectious diseases (23.8%) followed by pulmonary embolism (15.9%). 64 autopsies were classified as type II discrepancies (9.2%), with myocardial infarct the most common (37.5%), especially acute myocardial infarction (18 cases), followed by bronchoaspirations (18.7%), DIC (15.6%), massive haemorrhages (9.4%) and other conditions. It was considered that both the ICU and the Internal Medicine Service were responsible for the largest number of major discrepancies (type I and II), accounting for about 45% of type I and slightly more than 56% for type II.

Conclusion: Autopsies are an essential means of identifying ante-mortem clinical errors. The incidence of major discrepancies in the Central University Hospital of Asturias (18.3%) is comparable to that of leading hospitals worldwide.
