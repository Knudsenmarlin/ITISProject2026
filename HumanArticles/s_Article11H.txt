Objective: To evaluate the dental condition and the vertical dimension in patients with TMD, and the age and origin of the DTM.

Methods: Was performed a descriptive study, observational, cross-sectional, with a sample of thirty patients with TMD, diagnosed by Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). This sample was determined based on estimates the service thus a sample of convenience. The association between gender, age, vertical dimension and dental condition with TMD were verified using the chi-square statistical test with 95% confidence intervals.

Results: It found that 26 patients were female and 4 males. Fifteen subjects presented aged below 36.5 years. How much the origin of the DTM, 19 subjects had articular disorder, and 11 muscle disorder. Has been determined that there was no statistically significant association between the independent variables with the DTM.

Conclusion: The etiological factors analyzed in isolation do not seem to influence in a unique way in the development of TMD, but may act together with other factors, because the cause is multifactorial.
