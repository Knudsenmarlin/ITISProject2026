Introduction: the implementation of neonatal screening to identify infants with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The purpose of this study is to determine whether socio-economic factors are associated with acceptability of newborn screening to identify infants with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kisangani, DRC.

Methods: we conducted an observational study of mothers sensitized to neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease in their newborns with hemotypeSCTM (HT401RUO-USA). The study was carried out at the maternity wards in Kisangani from March 21st to June 30th 2020. Collected data were parity, educational level, age, socio-economic level, occupation, awareness and the reason for the denial of screening.

Results: out of 55.5% (273/492) of sensitized mothers, 107 (39.19%) accepted and 166 (60.80%) refused neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease in their newborn. The reasons for refusal were lack of information (67.5%; 95% CI [59.8-74.5]), lack of money due to confinement (66.3%; 95% CI [58.5-73.4]), blood test to develop a vaccine for protection against COVID-19 (63.2%; 95% CI = [55.4-70.6]). Factors associated with the acceptability of screening were age > 35 years (p = 0.0009; ORa = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.57-5.87) and low socio-economic level (p = 0.0016; ORa = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.37-3.85).

Conclusion: the acceptability of neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease during COVID-19 is low in Kisangani. The government should identify effective communication channels to promote health care initiatives.
