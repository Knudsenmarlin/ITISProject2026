Background: Pilates is a type of exercise recommended to diabetic patients due to its health benefits. Dark chocolate is also well known for its antioxidant properties. The purpose of this study has been to compare the effects of regular Pilates and flavanol-rich dark chocolate consumption on the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), fasting blood glucose (FBG) and BMI in diabetic females with peripheral neuropathy complications.

Methods: 36 diabetic patients enrolled in this single-blinded clinical trial. They were randomly allocated to the control (n = 12), Pilates and dark chocolate intake (n = 12), and Pilates and flavanol-free white chocolate (n = 12) groups. Two Pilates groups consumed 25 gr dark or white chocolate 10 min before each Pilates training session, three times per week, for 8 weeks. The control group consumed 25 gr of the same dark chocolate at a pre-determined time 3 times per week, without any regular exercise. Changes in TAC, BMI and FBG were then measured.

Results: Paired t-test analysis showed significant increases in the TAC status, as compared to the baseline in all groups (P ≤ 0.05). However, BMI and FBG reduction were not significant. Covariance (ANCOVA) analysis also showed a significant difference between groups (p < 0.05). Post-hoc Bonferroni test revealed the group that consumed dark chocolate before training had statistically significant increase in the TAC status compared to other groups.

Conclusion: The findings indicated that regular flavanol-rich dark chocolate consumption and Pilates significantly increased the TAC status. While FBG was reduced, it was not statistically significant.
