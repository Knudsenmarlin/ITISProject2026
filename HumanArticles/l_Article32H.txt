Objectives: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of transvaginal mesh surgery using a polytetrafluoroethylene mesh to treat pelvic organ prolapse.

Methods: This prospective observational study included women undergoing transvaginal mesh surgery for pelvic organ prolapse that used new polytetrafluoroethylene mesh cut into a shape similar to that of Elevate. We evaluated the subjective and objective outcomes at 3 and 12 months, as well as postoperative complication rates.

Results: This study included 55 patients. The pelvic organ prolapse quantification scores improved significantly at 3 and 12 months after surgery compared with scores before surgery. In four patients (7.3%), a pelvic examination showed stage 2 objective recurrence without subjective symptoms. Clavien-Dindo grades 2 and 3 perioperative complications were observed in 9.1% and 1.8% of the patients, respectively. Vaginal mesh exposure occurred in one patient (1.8%) at the time of the 3-month follow-up evaluation. The mesh was exposed at the proximal midline of the anterior vaginal wall.

Conclusions: These findings show the safe and effective use of the polytetrafluoroethylene mesh for transvaginal mesh surgery.
