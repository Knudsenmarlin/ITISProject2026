Resorbable materials are used to fix bony fragments after sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO), but to our knowledge, there is no clear regimen for antibiotic prophylaxis when such materials are used. The purpose of this study therefore was to compare inpatient single-agent and extended dual-agent antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of surgical site infections (SSI) in patients after SSRO. This prospective study included 100 patients who underwent SSRO for deformities of the jaw. Cephalometric analysis was performed preoperatively, and at one month and one year postoperatively. Patients were divided into two groups of 50 each. Group A was given cefazolin sodium 1g preoperatively and every eight hours for 48 hours postoperatively. Group B was given cefazolin sodium 1g preoperatively and every eight hours for 48 hours postoperatively, after which they were provided with oral amoxicillin for three days. Both groups were assessed for SSIs for one year postoperatively using the Clavien-Dindo classification. SSIs were documented in seven patients in Group A and six in Group B, with no significant difference between the groups. The two regimens had no significant association with SSI. In conclusion, our results suggest that the inpatient, single-agent, postoperative antibiotic regimen is sufficient to prevent SSI in patients who have SSRO with resorbable plate and screw fixation.
