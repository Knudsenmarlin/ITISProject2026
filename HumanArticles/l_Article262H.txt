Recent studies have shown that chromium (Cr) could alleviate the negative effects of heat stress on livestock and poultry, but there is little information available to laying ducks. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary addition of chromium propionate on laying performance, egg quality, serum biochemical parameters and antioxidant status of laying ducks under hot (average 32 °C) and humid (average 75% relative humidity) summer conditions. A total of 900 66-week-old weight- and laying-matched Shanma laying ducks were randomly divided into five treatments, each with 6 replicates of 30 individually caged birds. The birds were fed either a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with either 200, 400, 600, or 800 μg/kg Cr as chromium propionate. All laying ducks were given feed and water ad libitum for 5 weeks. The results showed that dietary supplementation with chromium propionate significantly increased the laying rate and yolk colour score (P < 0.05). Treatment with 400 μg/kg Cr as chromium propionate significantly decreased the feed/egg ratio by 5.4% (P < 0.05). Increased supplemental Cr from 0 to 800 μg/kg resulted in an increase in albumen height and the Haugh unit linearly (P < 0.05). Increased supplemental Cr decreased serum cortisol (P < 0.001, linear; P = 0.008, quadratic), heat shock protein-70 (P < 0.001, linear; P = 0.007, quadratic) and glucose (P = 0.007, linear), whereas it increased serum insulin (P = 0.011, Linear), total protein (P = 0.006, linear; P = 0.048, quadratic) and albumin (P = 0.035, linear; P = 0.088, quadratic). Dietary Cr levels increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, the total antioxidant capacity linearly and quadratically (P < 0.05). A linear and quadratic (P < 0.05) decrease of the malondialdehyde concentrations in response to dietary Cr level was observed. These results indicated that dietary supplementation of Cr as chromium propionate, particularly at 800 μg/kg could beneficially affect the laying rate, egg quality and antioxidant function, as well as modulate the blood biochemical parameters of laying ducks under heat stress conditions.
