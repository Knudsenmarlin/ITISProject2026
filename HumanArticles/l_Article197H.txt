Background: Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis is a fatal form because of high morbidity and poor recovery. Improper use of first line medicines and default treatment are the prime reasons of developing resistance of mycobacterium towards conventional anti- TB drugs. Nurses with refined knowledge, current evidence and positive attitude can prevent arising of MDR TB cases by ensuring adequate treatment, promoting treatment adherence and real time case monitoring. Because of paucity of data, present study was aimed to assess efficacy of m-learning in improving knowledge and attitude of nurses about the prevention and control of MDR-TB.

Methods: In this Quasi-randomized study, nurses working in the unit of pulmonary, emergency, respiratory ICU, general medicine of AIIMS Rishikesh during the months of August-October 2019 were involved. The number of participation was 190 (95 in each group; experimental and control) where m-learning intervention was available only for experimental group. There were structured questionnaire to measure knowledge and dichotomous checklist to evaluate attitude of nurses of both group before and one week after the provision of m-learning module.

Results: Both the group was homogeneous and m-learning intervention was effective to improve knowledge, when compared post-test knowledge score between experimental and control group (18.2 ± 5.4 vs 12.4 ± 4.4; P < 0.001); however, this one-time social media based intervention could not improve attitude of participants (10.3 ± 1.8 vs. 9.9 ± 1.8; P = 0.175).

Conclusion: Hence, m-learning is useful for knowledge development among large number of nurses within limited resource setting but frequent provision of technology based module is recommended to acquire positive attitude among nurses.
