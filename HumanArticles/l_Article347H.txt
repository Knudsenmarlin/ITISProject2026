Objectives: Uncontrolled TH17 differentiation has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of pregnancy loss. We recently showed that menstrual blood stromal/stem cells (MenSCs) alter functional features of natural killer cells. Here, we hypothesized that MenSCs could modulate differentiation of TH17 cells.

Method: MenSCs were collected from 18 apparently healthy women and characterized. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) served as a control. TH17 polarization and proliferation of purified T CD4+ cells were assessed by flow cytometry in a well-defined co-culture system containing T CD4+ cells and MenSCs or BMSCs. Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO) activity was evaluated in MenSC and BMSC culture supernatants by a colorimetric assay. The impact of MenSCs on expression of transcription factors, RORC, T-bet, Gata3, NRP-1 and Helios were studied by qPCR.

Results: MenSCs significantly inhibited TH17 differentiation (p = 0.0383) and percentage of the cells co-expressing IL-17 and IFN-γ (p = 0.0023). PGE2 blockade significantly reduced percentage and proliferation of T CD4+IL-17+ (p = 0.003, p = 0.0018), T CD4+ IFN-γ+ (p = 0.002, p = 0.0022) and T CD4+IL-17+ IFN-γ+ (p = 0.004, p = 0.02) cells. MenSCs produced a considerable activity of IDO (p = 0.0002), induced a significant rise in the Treg frequency (p = 0.0091) and a sharp increase in TH17/Tregs ratio (p = 0.0022). MenSCs increased expression of NRP1 (p = 0.001), while downregulated expression of RORC in T cells (p = 0.001).

Conclusion: Our results suggest a supportive role for MenSCs in establishing a pregnancy-friendly microenvironment in the uterus and put forth the idea that inherent abnormalities of MenSCs may be a basis for dysregulated endometrial immune network leading to pregnancy loss.
