Dairy calves may benefit from extending the duration of feeding transition milk (TM; the subsequent two to six milkings after parturition) to enhance performance and health during early life. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of replacing pasteurized waste milk (non-saleable milk containing antibiotic and/or drug residues) with pasteurized TM for 3 weeks on the growth performance and health of dairy calves. A total of 84 healthy newborn female Holstein calves were blocked by birth order and assigned randomly to 4 treatment groups with partial replacement of pasteurized waste milk by TM (second milkings after parturition) at 0 (0 l/day TM + 6 l/day milk), 0.5 (0.5 l/day TM + 5.5 l/day milk), 1 (1 l/day TM + 5 l/day milk), or 2 l (2 l/day TM + 4 l/day milk) for a 21-day period. From day 22 onward, all calves were fed individually with 6 l/day pasteurized waste milk. Calves were weaned on day 60 and monitored until day 90 of the study. Liquid feed DM intake (DMI) was increased with increasing levels of TM (P = 0.001). Starter feed DMI and total DMI (liquid feed DMI + starter feed DMI) were not affected by the treatment effect. Calves were fed 2 l/day TM gained more BW compared with those in the control group during the postweaning and overall periods. The average daily gain tended (P = 0.06) to be higher in calves fed 2 l/day TM compared with calves fed 0 (+ 65 g/day), 0.5 (+ 53 g/day), or 1 (+ 76 g/day) l/day TM during the preweaning period. Daily weight gain was also higher in calves fed 2 l/day TM compared with calves in the control group during the postweaning (+ 137 g/day; P = 0.04) and overall (+89 g/day; P < 0.01) periods, respectively. Calves fed 2 l/day TM had a higher feed efficiency compared with calves in the control group during all studied periods. The calves fed TM2 had a lower chance of having diarrhea compared with other treatment groups. Duration but not the frequency of diarrhea was lower in calves fed TM2 vs TM0 (2.5 vs 4.2days; P = 0.03). In general, partial replacement of waste milk with TM (2 l/day) may be recommended to feed dairy calves at an early stage of life to support a higher growth rate and health benefits.
