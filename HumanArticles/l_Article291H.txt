Objective: To evaluate the state of psychology and quality of life of patients effected by acne and also the efficacy and safety of photodynamic therapy with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA-PDT) for moderate to severe acne patients.

Methods: In the questionnaire part, a pre-designed form was filled out. The questionnaire was comprised of 2 sections related to acne including sociodemographic and disease information as well as Cardiff Acne Disability Index (CADI) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). In the trial part, the ALA-PDT was applied to moderate to severe acne patients. Fresh 5% ALA solution was topically applied to face or face & neck. After 1 h's incubation, a LED device was illuminated. A power density of 60-100 mW/cm2 was delivered for 20 min. All the patients finished 3-4 sessions of ALA-PDT at 7-10 days intervals. Non-invasive detections were taken for skin moisture, oil, and VISIA indexes. Adverse events were recorded during and after the treatment.

Results: A total of 247 acne patients finished questionnaires. Over 97 % patients were assessed as mild to severe impacts in CADI questionnaire and 37.6 % patients had various degrees of anxiety in SAS questionnaire. The higher the BMI was, the higher the CADI points were (G = 0.278, p = 0.005). The severity of acne was correlated with psychology and quality of life (CADI: G = 0.367, p = 0.000; SAS: G = 0.285, p = 0.003). A total of 116 patients with moderate or severe acne accepted ALA-PDT and completed at least 3 sessions (PDT3) or even PDT4. After 1 session of treatment (AT1) and AT2, the efficiencies of all patients were 5.2 % and 29.3 %. For patients with PDT3, the efficiencies at follow-up at 1st month after last session (FU1), FU2 and FU3 were 59.4 %, 66.7 % and 78.3 %, respectively. For patients with PDT4, the efficiencies at AT3 and FU1-3 were 51.3 %, 63.6 %, 76.5 % and 85.7 %, respectively. The efficacies of PDT4 patients showed an increasing trend from FU1 to FU3 (G = 0.480, p = 0.004). Acne lesions of mild to severe were correlated with the treatment efficacies (FU1: G = 0.354, p = 0.000; FU2: G = 0.474, p = 0.000; FU3: G = 0.397, p = 0.000). Nearly 15 % patients were followed up for 12 months and among them 52.9 % patients were able to maintain ≥90 % improvement rate. There were no statistically significant differences before and after treatment (p > 0.05) according to the skin moisture content, oil content, ultraviolet ray spots, brown spots, red areas, and purple textures measured. The adverse reactions of ALA-PDT, including local burning sensation, mild pain sensation, mild edema erythema, reactive acne, pigmentation, etc., were temporary and tolerable.

Conclusion: In our study, 97.2 % patients were rated as impact in CADI questionnaire and 37.6 % patients had anxiety in SAS questionnaire. It is necessary to control weight and disease progression. The efficiencies of ALA-PDT for moderate and severe acne were 59.4%-85.7% at follow-ups of 1st, 2nd or 3rd month after last session. The adverse reactions of ALA-PDT were temporary and tolerable.
