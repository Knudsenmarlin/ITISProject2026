Background: Administration of a bitter compound can alter the intragastric pressure (IGP) after a meal. Additionally, a negative correlation between IGP and the number of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) has been demonstrated. However, the effect of a bitter tastant on the number of TLESRs and subsequent reflux episodes has never been investigated and it is unclear whether bitter food items should be avoided in gastro-esophageal reflux disease. We hypothesize that bitter administration in healthy volunteers (HVs) will lead to an increase in the number of TLESRs.

Methods: After an overnight fast, 20 female HVs (36 years [21-63]) underwent a high-resolution impedance manometry (HRiM) measurement. After placement of the HRiM probe, 0.1 ml/kg of a 10 mM denatonium benzoate solution (bitter) or an identical volume of water (placebo) was administered directly into the stomach. The number of TLESRs and reflux episodes was quantified 30 min before and 2 h after consumption of a high caloric meal.

Key results: There was no significant difference in the number of TLESRs or reflux episodes between the bitter and placebo condition. Additionally, no differences were observed in the nature (gas or liquid) and extent of reflux events. Lower esophageal sphincter pressures dropped significantly in the first postprandial hour to start recovering slowly back to baseline values during the second postprandial hour (p < 0.0001), without any difference between both conditions.

Conclusions & interferences: Administration of the bitter tastant denatonium benzoate has no influence on the number of TLESRs or reflux episodes.
