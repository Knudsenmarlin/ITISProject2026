Introduction: Several studies suggests that the provision of auditory cues with music could be beneficial for people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of music-based physical therapy on the international Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) components: disability, cognition, muscle strength, balance, and functional mobility.

Methods: This was a controlled, non-randomized clinical trial involving 13 individuals with PD assessed at three times: baseline, period 1 (treatment), and period 2 (no treatment). The variables analyzed were: disability by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y), cognitive function by Trail Making Test, muscle strength by Medical Research Council (MRC) and sitting-rising (SR) test, balance and functional mobility by Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Timed up and Go (TUG). ANOVA with post-hoc multiple comparison was used to determine statistical differences between the baseline, period 1 and 2.

Results: there was statistically significant difference among the period 1 and 2 for the cognitive function; there was a statistically significant difference between the period 1 and 2 in SR test; in the balance evaluation by BBS, an increase was observed between the baseline and the period 1, followed by a decrease in period 2; in the TUG, there was an increase between the period 1 and 2.

Conclusion: the music-based physical therapy, according to the ICF construct, was able to improve balance and functional mobility in individuals with PD. The functional gains were not maintained when the therapy was discontinued.
