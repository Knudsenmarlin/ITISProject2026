Abdominal obesity is defined as an accumulation visceral fat in abdomen region. It is linked to metabolic disorders that contribute to chronic diseases. Triglyceride (TG) to high-density lipoprotein (TG/HDL) ratio is considered as an insulin resistance (IR) marker. The waist to height ratio (WHtR) has been advocated as an effective and convenient measurement of central adiposity that could potentially be superior instead of BMI in determining cardiometabolic risk. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of 8-wk-high protein diet and exercise on TG/HDL ratio, waist to height ratio (WHtR), body fat (BF) and body weight (BW). This study was a randomized clinical trial in 43 subjects with BMI >25 kg/m2. Subjects were randomized into 3 groups: High Protein Diet and Exercise (HPDE; n=15) High Protein Diet (HPD; n=15) and Control Group (CG; n=13). The prescribed diet consisted of 1,200 calories; while the exercise was conducted for 5 times/wk for 8 wk. The hypocaloric diet comprised of 55% carbohydrate, 25% protein, and 20% fat. In the end of the study, HPDE group had greater weight loss (-2.3±1.9 kg) than HPD (-1.8±2.2 kg); while CG increased in weight (1.8±1.3 kg). HPDE group had significantly improved TG, HDL, TG/HDL ratio and WHtR by -26.6 mg/dL, 12.7 mg/dL, -1.02, -0.02 respectively (p<0.05). There were significant differences between 3 groups, with ΔTG (p=0.008), ΔHDL (p=0.001), and ΔTG/HDL ratio (p=0.004) and WHtR (p=0.001). In conclusion, t hypocaloric diet combined with exercise has a beneficial effect in weight loss among young obese.
