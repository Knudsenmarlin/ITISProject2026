Introduction: Dynamic Tape™ (DT) is a biomechanical tape that is used to directly manage load, modify movement patterns, and assist functioning. However, no studies have evaluated its effectiveness in increasing gluteus medius (GM) muscle activation and improving functional performance.

Objective: To investigate the effect of two forms of DT applications on the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the GM muscle and lower limb functional performance.

Methods: Thirty-three, healthy, recreationally active women were randomly assigned into two groups: 1) submitted to the DT application on GM muscle that adhered to the stretching method for Kinesio Tape® application (KG, n = 17) and 2) submitted to the DT application on GM muscle that adhered to the stretching method suggested for DT (DG, n = 16). The EMG evaluation of GM was performed at rest, in maximum voluntary isometric contraction, and in the single-leg squat, drop landing, and jump landing + maximum vertical jump tests. Functional performance was evaluated using the triple hop test and the 6-m timed hop test.

Results: No significant changes in GM activation or functional performance were found, regardless of the stretching method used. No significant intergroup differences were observed (α = 5%).

Conclusion: DT did not increase GM activation in functional activities, and it did not improve functional performance in the lower limbs in healthy women, regardless of the form of application used.
