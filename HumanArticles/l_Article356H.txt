Background: While vancomycin powder and dilute povidone-iodine (VIP) is associated with fewer total joint arthroplasty (TJA) periprosthetic joint infections (PJI), its effect on PJI organism profiles is unclear. This study evaluates primary TJA PJI organism profiles before and after the implementation of a VIP protocol.

Methods: In total, 18,299 primary TJAs performed at a university-affiliated, not-for-profit orthopedic hospital from before (1/2012-12/2013) and after (1/2016-12/2019) a VIP protocol was initiated were reviewed to identify deep PJIs that occurred within 90 days of the index arthroplasty as defined by the Musculoskeletal Infection Society guidelines. Demographics, overall organism incidence (n/TJAs), and relative organism incidence (n/PJIs) from the two cohorts were compared.

Results: In total, 103 TJA PJIs were identified (pre-VIP: 32/3982; VIP: 71/14,317). Following the introduction of VIP, the overall and relative incidence of coagulase-negative staphylococcal TJA PJIs significantly decreased (overall: 0.20% to 0.04%, P = .004; relative: 25.00% to 8.45%, P = .031). In response, the relative incidence of MSSA TJA PJIs significantly increased (18.75% to 40.85%, P = .042). Broken down by arthroplasty type, VIP was associated with a significantly lower overall incidence of coagulase-negative staphylococcal total knee arthroplasty (TKA) PJIs (0.27% to 0.06%, P = .015), a significantly lower overall incidence of MRSA TKA PJIs (0.18% to 0.03%, P = .031), and a nonsignificant decrease in the overall incidence of gram-negative TKA PJIs (0.18% to 0.04%, P = .059). No organism profile changes were found in total hip arthroplasty PJIs.

Conclusion: VIP is not associated with more difficult to treat primary TJA PJIs. While promising, these findings require a prospective randomized controlled trial for confirmation.
