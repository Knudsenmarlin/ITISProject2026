Objective: To evaluate the compliance of the service of glucometry in drugstores in the department of Santander - Colombia.

Methods: Cross-sectional observational study. An assessment instrument based on the normativity and validated by experts was used.

Results: The poll was applied to 68 drugstores. The results were categorized as follows: human resources, equipment, infrastructure, documentation - registration, and surveillance and control processes. In the first category, shortcomings related to the academic training of the staff in charge of the drugstore were identified, with a compliance percentage of 66,2% and in the training of personnel in the management of the glucometry equipment, 35,3%. In general, the knowledge of the regulations by the staff was 36,8%. In the equipment and infrastructure categories, a level of compliance of more than 50% is evident for all items, xcept in those related to calibration equipment. In the fourth category, specifically in documentation and registration, the levels of regulatory compliance are less than 50% in all items, except in the one related with the information that is offered to the patient during the procedure. The results show a failure in the surveillance and control processes, where only 57,4% of the establishments confirm inspection visits.

Conclusions: The results of this study reveal widespread ignorance of the regulations in drugstores that provide the glucometry service; consequently, not all regulatory requirements are met. Promoting training programs and strengthening the culture of self-evaluation guarantees safe processes for the patient.
