Undernutrition and iron deficiencies on under-five children in Indonesia remain high and very closely related to inadequate complementary feeding. This study investigated the effect of weekly nutrition education by home visite using the food monitoring card (FMC) models and daily provision multi-nutrient biscuits and combination on growth and reduction of iron deficiency and anemia among underweight children aged 6-23 mo in Aceh Indonesia. A 6-mo, cluster randomized, control trial was conducted on 121 children received nutrition education (NE), multi-nutrient biscuit (MNB), combination both nutrition education and biscuits (NE+MNB), and control group. The outcome weight gain and prevalence of underweight (weight for age z-score <-2SD) were collected by anthropometric and iron deficiency were serum ferritin measuring with ELISA method. After the 6-mo intervention, the rate of weight gain was higher in combination intervention group 1.51±0.68 kg than multi-biscuit group 1.40±0.72 kg, NE group 1.34±0.66 kg and control group 1.21±0.42 kg, and the rate increase of serum ferritin was higher in combination NE+MNB and biscuit group (2.54 μg/L and 2,17 μg/L). At the end of study there were a significant decrease in prevalence of underweight (p=0.003), the incidence of underweight in NE+MNB (45.2%) lower than NE group (63.3%), MNB group (64.5%) and control group (69,0%) and significant decrease of iron deficiency (p=0.02), the incidence lower in MNB group (6.5%) than NE+MNB (22.6%), NE group (23.3%) and control group (24.1%). The combination of nutritional education and multi-nutrient biscuits intervention improving nutritional and iron deficiency status on undernourished children. These risearch highlight the need integration of nutrition education and food base intervention to prevent underweight and iron deficiency on children 6-23 mo old.
