Objective: Various studies have shown racial differences in adult cardiac chamber measurements by echocardiography. There is lack of any large scale data from India regarding the echocardiographic chamber measurements in cardiologically healthy individuals. In this study we present the normal reference values of echocardiographic chamber dimensions in young eastern Indian adults and compare it with the data in present guidelines and recent studies involving Indian subjects.

Methods: This study was performed on 1377 healthy adults aged 18-35 years. Standard transthoracic echocardiographies were performed to obtain basic measurements. All measurements were indexed to body surface area.

Results: The mean maximal aortic valve cusp separation (ACS) and indexed ACS were significantly more in females (p = 0.002, p = 0.03). Mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV fractional shortening were marginally higher in females. Upper normal reference limit of LV end diastolic dimension (LVEdD) is slightly more for males. Comparing to ASE data, LVEdD, LV end systolic dimension, LV end diastolic volume, indexed LV end systolic volume, left atrial anteroposterior dimension, aortic root dimension and right ventricle outflow diameter were significantly lower in study population while LVEF was significantly higher (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion: The study reconfirms that Indian subjects have smaller cardiac chamber measurements compared to western population where as LVEF is higher in the Indian population and also demonstrates the wide variation of normal echocardiographic measurements within Indian subcontinent. No previous data from eastern India makes this research a singular experience.
