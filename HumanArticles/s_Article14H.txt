Abstract
Background: High-dose opioids are conventionally used for cardiac anesthesia, but without monitoring of nociception. In non-cardiac surgical procedures the intra - operative dose of opioids can be individualized and reduced with pupillometric monitoring of the pupillary pain index (PPI; scale 1-9). A randomized controlled trial was carried out to explore whether pupillometry can be used for nociception monitoring in cardiac anesthesia and whether it leads to opioid reduction.

Methods: A sample of 57 cardiac surgery patients receiving continuously administered sufentanil (initial dosage 0.7 μg*kg-¹*h-¹) was divided into a PPI group (sufentanil reduction if PPI<3 up to a minimum of 0.15 μg*kg-¹*h-¹, n=32) and a control group (standard anesthesia; n = 25). The primary outcome was the time from the end of anesthesia to extubation. The secondary outcomes were total intraoperative dose of sufentanil/noradrenaline, postoperative pain intensity (numeric rating scale [NRS] 0-10) and intraoperative awareness. German Clinical Trials Registry no. DRKS 00012329.

Results: The primary outcome, extubation time, did not differ between the two groups (1.14 h, 95% confidence interval [-0.99; 3.27], p = 0.592). Compared with the control patients (68% male, age 70 ± 10.4 years, PPI 1.1 ± 0.2), the mean sufentanil infusion rate in the PPI patients (81% male, age 68 ± 10.3 years, PPI 1.1 ± 0.2) decreased by 81.8% (-0.68 μg*kg-¹*h-¹ [-0,7; -0.67], p<0.001) to the predetermined minimum level, without intraoperative awareness. Moreover, the noradrenaline dose was reduced by 56% (1235.51 μg [321.91; 2149.12], p = 0.005) and the postoperative pain intensity by 45% (2.11 NRS [0.93; 3.3] after 24 h, p = 0.003).

Conclusion: Pupillometry is appropriate for nociception monitoring in cardiac anesthesia. Thereby a considerable reduction of intraoperative opioids as well as increased intraoperative hemodynamic stability was achieved and postoperative opioid-induced hyperalgesia was prevented. The consistently low PPI scores, indicating adequate analgesia, suggest that further reduction of opioid doses is feasible.
