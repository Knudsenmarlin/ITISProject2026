Dudley, CE, Drinkwater, EJ, and Feros, SA. Different cluster-loading protocols have no effect on intraset and interset power expression. J Strength Cond Res 36(7): 1763-1769, 2022-This study investigated the effect of cluster-loading protocols on changes in hang power clean (HPC) power characteristics. Ten trained weightlifters (7 male, 3 female, HPC 1.28 [M]; 1.03 [F] × body mass) completed 4 experimental protocols in a randomized repeated-measures design. Protocols were traditional, a basic cluster, and 2 undulating clusters. Each protocol comprised 3 sets of 5 HPC repetitions at an average of 70% 1 repetition maximum (RM). The load for undulating cluster protocols ranged between 60 and 80% 1RM. Countermovement jumps (CMJs) were performed before and after each protocol to gauge effect on neuromuscular status. Statistical analysis comprised a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance. Peak power was significantly greater in the fifth repetition of the basic cluster set protocol compared with the traditional set protocol (mean ± SD: 6.6 ± 2.8%, p = 0.043, g = 0.25). Neither undulating load protocol significantly altered set power characteristics compared with basic cluster sets; however, when analyzing repetition data, peak power increased as load increased (and vice versa), indicating the prescribed loads were suboptimal for power expression in this sample. There was no change in CMJ height between protocols. Coaches should prescribe inter-repetition rest to maintain peak power across multiple repetitions and sets. Basic cluster protocols seem to be the most practical choice over undulating cluster protocols because there is no need to adjust load between repetitions.
