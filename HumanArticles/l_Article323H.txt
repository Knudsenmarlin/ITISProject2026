Information on weaning techniques in the tropics is scarce, particularly regarding the long-term effect of temporary early cow-calf separation or restricted suckling. Therefore, we studied the effects of these two handling practices on well-being and performance at 150 days postpartum in fifteen zebu cow-calf pairs randomly assigned to three treatments. Continuous suckling (CS) where calves remained with their dams from birth to weaning; restricted suckling (RS) calves were allowed to suckle 30 min/day from Day 34 until weaning at Day 150 and kept separated the rest of the time; temporary separation (TS) calves were separated for 72 h from their dams from Day 33 to 36 but remained with their dams the rest of the time. Blood samples and behavioral data were collected on Days 32-36 (1st period) and 149-153 (2nd period). In the 1st period, a greater percentage of RS and TS calves were observed close to the fence line (<10 m) that separated them from their dams (P < 0.0001) and vocalized more than CS calves (P < 0.0001), while in the 2nd period, RS calves had the highest cortisol concentration and vocalization rate (P < 0.05). Similarly, during the 1st period, a greater percentage of RS and TS cows were observed close to the fence line than CS cows (P < 0.0001), with TS cows vocalizing the most (P = 0.001). In the 2nd period, RS cows had greater cortisol concentration than TS (P = 0.037) and CS cows (P = 0.003). More TS and CS cows than RS were observed close to the fence line (P = 0.03 and P = 0.05). On Day 150, TS calves and cows vocalized more than RS and CS animals (P < 0.0001). Before calf-cow separation, 27 out of 45 cows were cycling (CS = 10; RS = 6; TS = 11). After separation, 12 of the remaining 18 cows resumed ovarian activity (CS = 3; RS = 5; TS = 4), and all cows were cycling after estrous synchronization treatment. The pregnancy rate was similar between CS, RS, and TS (60, 53, and 60% respectively). In conclusion, temporary separation increased calf distress response to definitive weaning even four months later, while restricted suckling seemed to reduce it.
