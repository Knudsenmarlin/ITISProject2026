Objectives: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral agent valacyclovir compared with famciclovir in the treatment of herpes zoster.

Materials and methods: A comparative study was conducted over a period of 1 year. Data relevant to the study were collected from 60 patients, with active herpes zoster presenting to the outpatient department within 72 hr of the first occurrence of zoster rash. They were divided in to two groups of 30 patients each. The first group of patients received valacyclovir tablet 1000 mg thrice daily, whereas those in the second group were given famciclovir tablet 500 mg thrice daily. Both the drugs were given for 7 days. Periodic follow-up till 29th day was done for assessment of the effects of given drugs.

Results: Significant decrease was observed on comparison of pain scores between the two groups using the visual analog scale, with the drug valacyclovir, than in the famciclovir group at day 29. Furthermore, valacyclovir treatment accelerated the resolution of zoster associated pain in more number of patients compared with famciclovir.

Conclusion: Oral valacyclovir administered during acute zoster infection for a period of 7 days offers significant benefit compared to famciclovir by providing a well tolerated and greater resolution of pain while maintaining the favorable safety profile, making valacyclovir more efficacious and a better drug in management of Herpes Zoster in comparison to famciclovir.
