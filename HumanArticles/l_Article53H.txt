Background: Kidney disease has historically been the primary source of early mortality in adults with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Kidney imaging surveillance promotes early detection of lesions requiring intervention. We describe kidney imaging frequency in relationship to patient-level characteristics for commercially insured patients with TSC in the United States.

Methods: This retrospective observational study used 2003 to 2016 enrollment and claims data from a de-identified fully insured commercial health insurer. Patients with TSC less than 65 years were included. The patient-level kidney imaging rate was calculated as the number of kidney imaging procedures divided by length of continuous enrollment. A multiple linear regression model was used to determine the relationship between imaging rate and progression of TSC-associated kidney disease, number of specialists seen, and nephrologist care.

Results: At least half of the 70 patients with TSC included in the study were aged 16 years or younger. Over a follow-up period of up to 14 years, the median kidney imaging rate was 0.13 procedures per year with 43% (N = 30) of patients lacking evidence of kidney imaging during the observation period. Imaging frequency increased with progression of TSC-associated kidney disease, more specialists, and nephrologist care (P < 0.05 for all three in regression model).

Conclusions: A substantial percentage of patients with TSC in the United States are at risk for delayed detection of kidney manifestations due to infrequent kidney imaging surveillance. Multispecialty care, including neurologists, may positively affect kidney surveillance rates.
