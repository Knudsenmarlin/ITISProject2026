Objectives: Mother-to-child transmission of HIV has witnessed a significant reduction due to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Efavirenz has been introduced as a part of ART since last few years in the national Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) program for pregnant women living with HIV. However, data related to adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with efavirenz-based ART are limited in the Indian scenario. The present study evaluated pregnancy outcomes in HIV-infected pregnant women who were given efavirenz-based ART during pregnancy.

Materials and methods: It is a retrospective, observational, analytic study carried out at a referral hospital in Western India. Collection of data was done for a period of 5 years, and various adverse outcomes were studied which included preterm delivery, low birth weight (LBW), stillbirths, congenital anomaly, and neonatal death.

Results: This study showed a preterm birth rate of 19% and LBW in 36% of cases. There was no significant association with congenital anomaly, stillbirth, or neonatal death.

Conclusion: There was an association of exposure to efavirenz with an increased incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially LBW infants. This study emphasizes the requirement of large prospective studies to investigate fetomaternal outcomes in pregnant women exposed to efavirenz.
