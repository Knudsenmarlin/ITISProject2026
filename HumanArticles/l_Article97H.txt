Background: Horner syndrome (HS) is characterised by the triad of upper eyelid ptosis, miosis, and facial anhidrosis. Due to its wide variety of causes, it can occur at any age, and is uncommon in paediatrics. The aetiology and diagnostic approach of paediatric HS (PHS) is controversial.

Objective: The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics of a 14 case series, focusing on the aetiology of HS and the clinical evolution the patients presented.

Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted on patients under 14 years-old (enrolled between 1st January 2009 and 30th April 2020). Depending on the age at diagnosis (before or after the first 5 months of life), the study cases were divided into two groups: congenital or acquired.

Results: Fourteen patients, with a mean age of 8.5 months, were enrolled. The most frequent cause of PHS were tumours (6/14), with the most representative neoplasm being neuroblastoma (4/14). Of the acquired cases (8/14), the most frequent cause was iatrogenic (5/8), mainly secondary to cervical or thoracic surgery. The main origin of congenital HS (6/14) was neuroblastoma (4/6), being the first manifestation of the disease in 50% of patients (2/4).

Conclusion: HS may be the first sign of a major underlying disease, such as neuroblastoma. For this reason, children presenting with HS of unknown origin require imaging studies to exclude a life threatening disease. A thorough examination is essential for early diagnosis of these patients.
