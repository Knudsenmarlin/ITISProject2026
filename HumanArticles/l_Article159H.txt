Background: Clinical studies suggest that isoniazid contributes rapid bacterial killing during the initial two days of tuberculosis treatment but that isoniazid's activity declines significantly after day three. We conducted a 14-day phase IIa open label, randomized trial to assess the essentiality of isoniazid in standard tuberculosis therapy.

Methods: A total of 69 adults with newly diagnosed sputum-positive tuberculosis from the South African Western Cape region were enrolled and randomized to a four-arm parallel assignment model. Participants were followed for 14 days as inpatients at either the University of Cape Town Lung Institute or at the TASK Applied Science clinical research organization. All arms received standard daily rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide but differed as follows: isoniazid only on days one and two (n=17), isoniazid on days one and two then moxifloxacin on days three through 14 (n=16), no isoniazid (n=18), and a control group that received isoniazid for all 14 days (standard therapy, n=18). The primary endpoint was the rate of colony forming unit (CFU) decline during the first 14 days of treatment.

Results: For 62 participants analyzed, the initial 14-day mean daily fall in log10 CFU (95% CI) was 0·14 (0·11, 0·18) for participants receiving isoniazid for two days only; 0·13 (0·09, 0·17) for participants receiving isoniazid for two days followed by moxifloxacin; 0·12 (0·08, 0·15) for those not receiving isoniazid; and 0·13 (0·09, 0·16) for the standard therapy group.

Conclusions: The 14 day EBA for the combination rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was not significantly changed by the addition of isoniazid for the first two days or for the first 14 days of treatment. In a post hoc analysis, significantly higher day-two EBAs were observed for all groups among participants with higher baseline sputum CFUs. Our finding that INH does not contribute to EBA suggests that INH could be replaced with another drug during standard treatment to improve efficacy and decrease rates of resistance to first-line drugs.
