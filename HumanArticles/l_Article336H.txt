Introduction: The installation of young general practitioners is determined by several factors, including their professional project. In 2012, a quantitative observational study examined the professional projects of general medicine residents in Angers. In 2019, the objective of this study was to highlight a continuity between professional projects and current exercise.

Method: Quantitative declarative study by online form carried out from May to July 2019, about socio-demographic data, current exercise, and factors of evolution of the professional projects. The inclusion criteria were to have responded to the 2012 study and to have agreed to be contacted (N = 167). Construction of a change indicator (ISPP) based on a comparison of the mode of practice, the structure of practice and the type of patient envisaged, envisaged in 2012 and actual in 2019.

Results: The response rate was 76.6%. 48.4% worked exclusively in liberal practice, 31.3% were salaried, 11.7% had a mixed exercise. The professional plan envisaged during the internship (ISPP) was followed completely by 67.7% of interns and partially by 17.3%. The SASPAS influenced the evolution of the professional project (P = 0.026). The multiplication of liberal practice internships during residency favored subsequent liberal practice (P &lt; 0.001). The main factors declared in the development of professional projects were training (77.3%) and family situation (53.1%).

Conclusion: This cohort follow-up showed that more than two thirds of the residents followed their initial project. Identification and support of these individual projects during residency could be a way to promote their realization.
