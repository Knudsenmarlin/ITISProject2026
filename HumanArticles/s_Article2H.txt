Abstract
Introduction: Shoulder adhesive capsulitis is a common pathology in middle aged population, physical therapy being the mainstay treatment for it. Various conventional treatment modalities have been proven to help in this condition. Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization (IASTM) is a considerably new technique, which is being used widely for various sports related injuries for a faster recovery. This study proposes to evaluate the effect of IASTM as an added treatment for improving pain, range of motion and functional ability in patients with adhesive capsulitis.

Method: 30 shoulders were randomly allocated into two groups- Group A (IASTM + conventional treatment) and Group B (conventional treatment). Treatment was given for 12 sessions, 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks. Participants were evaluated pre treatment, post 6th session and post 12th session. Outcome measures was Numerical Pain Rating Scale, Shoulder Pain And Disability Index, Shoulder Range of Motion, Apley's scratch test.

Results: Pain and Disability scale had shown improvement within the group only. However, in experimental group significant improvement was seen in active and passive mobility including functional performance.

Conclusion: IASTM along with conventional protocol was able to improve mobility and function among adhesive capsulitis patients.
