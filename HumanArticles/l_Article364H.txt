High levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in avian sperm cause more susceptibility to lipid peroxidation. Aging in roosters reduces the antioxidant capacity of sperm and thus fertility. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different levels of alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) as a feed supplement to improve the semen quality and fertility parameters of aged broiler breeder roosters and identification of its most effective level. A total of forty-two roosters at 45 wk of age were randomly assigned to 7 treatments (0, 15, 40, 70, 95, 120, and 145 mg ALA/bird per day) for 8 wk. Semen parameters and body weight were assessed biweekly, and testosterone plasma levels were determined in the 8th wk of the experimental period. Artificial insemination was performed at the end of the experiment to evaluate the fertility potential. The dietary administration of ALA had no significant effects on body weight, semen volume, average path velocity, linearity, straightness, wobble, the amplitude of lateral head displacement, beat-cross frequency, sperm concentration, morphology, plasma testosterone level, fertility, or hatchability (P > 0.05). Alpha-lipoic acid supplementations resulted in a significant decrease in seminal malondialdehyde concentration and immotile (type D) sperms (P < 0.05). The total motility, progressive motility (types A + type B sperms), curvilinear velocity, straight-line velocity, viability, and membrane integrity of sperm improved with ALA dietary supplementations (P < 0.05). With increasing ALA levels, improvement in semen parameters had an incremental trend until the level of 95 mg ALA. Thus, 95 mg dietary ALA as an antioxidant supplement can improve semen quality of aging breeder roosters while higher doses resulted in no further improvement.
