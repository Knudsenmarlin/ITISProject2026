The destruction of periodontal tissues during periodontitis is the result of the immune-inflammatory reactions to the bacteria of dental biofilm. Probiotics may reduce dysbiosis by the modification of the dental microbiome, which can influence the immune-inflammatory mechanisms. The aim of this study was to estimate the clinical and microbiological parameters, before and after 30 days of application of the dietary supplement containing Lactobacillus salivarius SGL03 or placebo. The study was conducted in 51 patients with stage I or II periodontitis during the maintenance phase of treatment. The clinical parameters and the number of colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria in supragingival plaque were assessed before and after 30 days of the oral once daily administration of the dietary supplement in the form of suspension containing L. salivarius SGL03 or placebo. There were no changes in the PI scores between and within the groups. The value of BOP decreased in both groups. In the study group the significant reduction of the mean pocket depth was revealed (from 2.5 to 2.42, p = 0,027) but without the difference between the groups. There were no significant changes in the number of bacteria within the groups. In the control, but not the study group, positive correlations were observed between the clinical parameters (variables) and the number of bacteria. The use of the dietary supplement containing L. salivarius SGL03 may reduce pocket depth despite the lack of changes in other clinical parameters and the number of bacteria in supragingival plaque.
