Background: Neural mobilization (NM) techniques have been shown to improve the neural tissue's viscoelastic properties that may lead to recover of the function of the nerve after lumbar spine surgery. This study aimed to determine the effects of NM in addition to standard rehabilitation on lumbar and sciatic pain intensity, disability level, and quality of life in patients after receiving a microdiscectomy of the intervertebral lumbar disc (IVD).

Methods: Twenty-four participants (age 41.3 ± 8.3 years old) within 3-4 weeks of a microdiscectomy of an IVD were randomly allocated to control (CTRL; n = 12) or NM group (n = 12). The CTRL group received ten standard rehabilitation sessions. The NM group received the same rehabilitation sessions with the addition of NM techniques. The intensity of lumbar and sciatic pain (visual analogue scale), disability level (Oswestry disability index), and health-related quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) were measured before and after the intervention.

Results: Within-group analysis revealed a significant reduction in lumbar (p < 0.05) and sciatic pain intensity (p < 0.001), disability level (p < 0.001), and improvement in the physical function and problems, vitality, emotional well-being, and pain SF-36 items (p < 0.05) in both groups. There were no statistical differences between groups in all outcomes.

Conclusion: A standard rehabilitation protocol alone or in combination with NM techniques are equally effective in reducing pain and disability level, as well as improving quality of life in patients after a microdiscectomy due to intervertebral lumbar disc lesion.
