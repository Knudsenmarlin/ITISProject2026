In general, calf production occurs in less intensive systems. The limitation of nutrients during the gestation phase of beef cows can have negative impacts on the consequent productivity of females. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of nutritional levels in the third trimester of pregnancy on the productive performance of beef cows kept in a natural pasture (NP). Eighty-three Charolais × Nelore cows were used, ranging in age from 4 to 12 years, which were divided according to their nutritional levels during the third trimester of pregnancy: NP, cows supplemented with 100% of their energy and protein requirements (SP100) and cows supplemented with 150% of their energy and protein requirements (SP150). The experimental design was completely randomized with three treatments and a varied number of repetitions. The SP100 and SP150 cows presented better body condition at calving (2.92 and 2.99 vs 2.81 points) and at the start of the breeding season (2.90 and 2.95 vs 2.80 points) than did NP cows. The nutritional level of the cows in the third trimester of gestation did not influence the blood metabolite concentrations. The plasma levels of albumin and total proteins were 3.11 and 8.18 g/dl, respectively. Glucose and cholesterol showed values of 74.96 and 166.50 mg/dl. The lowest concentration of blood metabolites was observed in the first postpartum weeks. The SP100 and SP150 cows showed faster follicular growth and, consequently, a higher percentage of females with ovulatory follicles at 21 days postpartum than did NP cows (45.68, 41.11, and 11.00%, respectively). The SP150 cows had a higher pregnancy rate (40.74%), total calf production (295.88 kg/cow), and consequently, offspring sale value. An increased nutritional level in the third trimester of pregnancy improves the postpartum metabolic condition and productive efficiency of beef cows kept on NP.
