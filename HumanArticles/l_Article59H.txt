Background: Circadian disturbances are commonly seen in people with Alzheimer's disease and have been reported in individuals without symptoms of dementia but with Alzheimer's pathology. We aimed to assess the temporal relationship between circadian disturbances and Alzheimer's progression.

Methods: We did a prospective cohort study of 1401 healthy older adults (aged >59 years) enrolled in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA) who had been followed up for up to 15 years. Participants underwent annual assessments of cognition (with a battery of 21 cognitive performance tests) and motor activities (with actigraphy). Four measures were extracted from actigraphy to quantify daily and circadian rhythmicity, which were amplitude of 24-h activity rhythm, acrophase (representing peak activity time), interdaily stability of 24-h activity rhythm, and intradaily variability for hourly fragmentation of activity rhythm. We used Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regressions to assess whether circadian disturbances predict an increased risk of incident Alzheimer's dementia and conversion of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia. We used linear mixed-effects models to investigate how circadian rhythms changed longitudinally and how the change integrated to Alzheimer's progression.

Findings: Participants had a median age of 81·8 (IQR 76·3-85·7) years. Risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia was increased with lower amplitude (1 SD decrease, hazard ratio [HR] 1·39, 95% CI 1·19-1·62) and higher intradaily variability (1 SD increase, 1·22, 1·04-1·43). In participants with mild cognitive impairment, increased risk of Alzheimer's dementia was predicted by lower amplitude (1 SD decrease, HR 1·46, 95% CI 1·24-1·72), higher intradaily variability (1 SD increase, 1·36, 1·15-1·60), and lower interdaily stability (1 SD decrease, 1·21, 1·02-1·44). A faster transition to Alzheimer's dementia in participants with mild cognitive impairment was predicted by lower amplitude (1 SD decrease, odds ratio [OR] 2·08, 95% CI 1·53-2·93), increased intradaily variability (1 SD increase, 1·97, 1·43-2·79), and decreased interdaily stability (1 SD decrease, 1·35, 1·01-1·84). Circadian amplitude, acrophase, and interdaily stability progressively decreased over time, and intradaily variability progressively increased over time. Alzheimer's progression accelerated these aging effects by doubling or more than doubling the annual changes in these measures after the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, and further doubled them after the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. The longitudinal change of global cognition positively correlated with the longitudinal changes in amplitude and interdaily stability and negatively correlated with the longitudinal change in intradaily variability.

Interpretation: Our results indicate a link between circadian dysregulation and Alzheimer's progression, implying either a bidirectional relation or shared common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.
