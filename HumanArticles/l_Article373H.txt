The transition to college represents a period of increased risk for developing a range of mental health conditions, highlighting the need for effective preventive interventions delivered in this setting. The purpose of the present study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a preventive version of the unified protocol for college students; this intervention, called emotions 101 was provided in a very brief, online course format. Unselected students (N = 243) were randomized to either the course (n = 120) or wait-list (n = 123) condition, and all participants were asked to complete self-report measures of stress, negative affectivity, and quality of life at baseline, 1-month, 6-month, and 8-month follow-up time points. Despite recruitment challenges, once participants enrolled in the course, they were likely to complete it and provide favorable satisfaction ratings and qualitative feedback. With regard to efficacy, there were no significant differences on our primary (emotional) outcomes (i.e., stress, negative affectivity, quality of life) as a function of condition, though individuals randomized to receive the course demonstrated significantly higher grade point averages at the end of their first college semester than those in the wait-list condition. Taken together, the findings from the present study suggest that a very brief, online prevention program for emotional disorders administered in a healthy sample does not significantly impact mental health variables.
