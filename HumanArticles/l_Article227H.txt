Background: Predicting tolerability and treatment-related risks associated with azacitidine (AZA) in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) before the initiation of therapy is required for appropriate treatment. Thus, in this study, the nutritional status of patients with MDS prior to AZA treatment was evaluated using the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI). Tolerability and overall survival (OS) after AZA initiation were also investigated.

Methods: This was a single-center retrospective observational study. A total of 59 patients with MDS treated with AZA were assessed using GNRI, and a comparison of undernourished (GNRI <92, n = 27) and non-undernourished (GNRI ≥92, n = 32) patients was performed.

Results: The undernourished group had a significant reduction in the number of patients that successfully completed 4 cycles of AZA treatment compared with the non-undernourished group (undernourished group, 11/27 patients, 40.7% vs. non-undernourished group, 24/32 patients, 75.0%; p = 0.009). Factors associated with the difference included karyotype and GNRI. There was also a significant increase in the rate of infectious complications in the undernourished group compared with the non-undernourished group (undernourished group, 33/60 cycles, 55.0% vs. non-undernourished group, 31/92 cycles, 33.7%; p = 0.012). Lastly, a significant reduction in OS was observed in the undernourished group compared with the non-undernourished group (undernourished group, 11.5 months; 95% CI, 5.2-16.7 vs. non-undernourished group, 21.9 months; 95% CI, 13.8-24.0; p = 0.026). Factors associated with OS included both the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) and GNRI.

Conclusions: These results indicate that predicting treatment completion and adverse events in patients with MDS prior to AZA treatment is important. This study suggests GNRI may be a valuable nutritional assessment tool for determining tolerability and OS of AZA treatment.
