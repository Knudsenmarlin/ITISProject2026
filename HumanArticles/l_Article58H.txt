Objectives: To assess patient satisfaction after pharmacy-mediated replacement of the originator etanercept prefilled syringe with its biosimilar prefilled pen.

Methods: Prospective observational study from March to May 2018, to assess satisfaction with the new drug dispensed. Patients were asked to answer a paper questionnaire with three questions: pain at injection site, ease of administration, and overall patient satisfaction with the change, rated on a scale from 1 (not satisfied) to 5 (extremely satisfied).

Results: The questionnaire was given to 134 patients (74 men, 60 women), with an average age of 55 years. 118 patients (88%) were from the Rheumatology Service and 16 patients (12%) from Dermatology. The median treatment duration with etanercept was 61 months. 87 (65%) completed questionnaires were collected. The mean pain score was 3.4. Most patients found administration easy with the biosimilar pen, with an average score of 3.7. Mean overall satisfaction was rated at 3.3, being higher among men, younger patients, and those with shorter duration of treatment.

Conclusions: The change of the original product from etanercept to a biosimilar product was acceptable for most of the patients who responded to the survey. Surveys allow us to determine the opinion and preferences of patients, thus achieving higher satisfaction with their treatment. Further research is needed to evaluate the effect of automatic replacement. A collaborative multidisciplinary switching programme should be implemented based on the feedback provided by patients.
