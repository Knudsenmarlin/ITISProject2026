Background: Bronchiectasis severity Index (BSI) score which predicts the severity of the disease along with future exacerbations and mortality rate has been well validated in European patients; however there is paucity of data evaluating its validity in Indian patients. The authors therefore decided to evaluate the utility of BSI to predict exacerbations and mortality rate in patients with post tubercular bronchiectasis presenting to our facility.

Methods: The study was a retrospective observational study done in patients with bronchiectasis secondary to tuberculosis. These patients were followed up for 4 years. BSI was calculated from different variables and descriptive statistics along with regression analysis were used to evaluate utility of BSI.

Results: A total of 48 patients of post tubercular bronchiectasis were included in the study. Majority of our patients belonged to severe bronchiectasis group seen in 23 patients (48%) while those with mild and moderate bronchiectasis were seen in 13 (27%) and 12 (25%) patients respectively. The exacerbation rate in mild group was comparable to the predicted BSI exacerbation at 1 year while the predicted and observed rates were statistically significant for moderate and severe bronchiectasis group (p value < 0.05). Mortality rates at 1 year were comparable in all the groups of bronchiectasis while it was comparable only in mild and moderate group bronchiectasis at 4 years.

Conclusion: Bronchiectasis severity index seems to predict mortality at 1 year in post tuberculosis bronchiectasis. However, it under predicts 1 year and 4 year exacerbation rates. Hence BSI may not be useful as a prognostic tool in Indian patients with bronchiectasis. Larger multi-centred studies may be required to further evaluate the clinical utility of BSI among Indian population.
