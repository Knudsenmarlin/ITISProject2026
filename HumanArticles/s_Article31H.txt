Abstract
Objective. To investigate the effectiveness of using problem-solving and worked examples in teaching clinical note writing to Doctor of Pharmacy students.Methods. First year student pharmacists who were recruited to participate in the study first studied a worked example on generating a clinical note from a written patient case. Participants were then randomized either to study another worked example or to practice writing a clinical note from a written patient case. Embedded in each condition was problem variability (ie, participants encountered either a similar disease state as that in the initial worked example or a different disease state). The primary outcome was the combined performance on writing two clinical notes. Secondary outcomes included quiz performance on knowledge of the components of a clinical note and ability to transfer writing skills to a novel disease state.Results. Seventy-nine students completed the study. Participants who studied a worked example followed by problem-solving (WE-PS) practice performed better than participants who studied two worked examples (WE-WE) on clinical note writing. However, there was no difference in their respective knowledge as determined by quiz performance.Conclusion. Both worked examples and problem-solving facilitated students' learning of the basic knowledge of clinical note writing. However, only problem-solving improved student pharmacists' ability to apply that knowledge. While there were significant improvements in student pharmacists' knowledge of the basics of clinical note writing, it is unclear how worked examples or problem-solving influence the clinical decision-making skills needed to write a clinical note.
