The use of medicinal zinc oxide (ZnO) in post-weaning diets must be phased out in the European Union by 2022, resulting in urgent needs for alternative strategies to prevent diarrhea in pigs. The objective of this study was to test the effect of four different dietary protein strategies with different amino acid profiles on diarrhea frequency and pig performance as alternative diet plans when medicinal ZnO was will be excluded from the diet. A total of 6 800 Duroc x (Danish Landrace x Yorkshire) pigs, weaned around 28 days of age, were randomly assigned by sex and size to six dietary treatments. The treatments were; standard CP levels (191, 184, 184 g/kg CP) and allocated 2 500 ppm ZnO in phase 1 (PC = positive control), standard CP levels (191, 184, 184 g/kg CP) and no added ZnO in phase 1 (NC = negative control), CP levels of 166, 184, 184 g/kg (LSS = low-standard-standard), CP levels of 166, 162, 192 g/kg (LLH = low-low-high), CP levels of 140, 193, 192 g/kg (VHH = very low-high-high), and lastly 140, 174, 192 g/kg CP levels (VMH = very low-medium-high). The pigs entered the trial at ~7 kg BW and exited at ~30 kg BW. As expected, the PC treatment resulted in 42% fewer diarrhea pen treatments in the total trial period compared to the NC group (P < 0.05), whereas both PC and LLH had fewer diarrhea treatment days per pig compared to NC pigs (P < 0.05). Additionally, at the point of treatment, the NC pens had 33% fecal floor samples positive for pathogens, compared to 80% samples positive for pathogens in the PC pens. This suggests that ZnO has a particular positive effect on non-infectious diarrhea without bacterial involvement. A reduction in dietary CP levels in phase 1 led to a reduced average daily gain (ADG) in LLH and VMH pigs and a poorer feed conversion ratio (FCR) in VHH pigs during the overall study period compared to the NC pigs (P < 0.05). Conclusively, a diet with low CP levels from weaning to about 15 kg BW had a reducing effect on diarrhea, but decreased ADG without affecting the FCR.
