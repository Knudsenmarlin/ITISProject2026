Evidence-based behavior therapy for adolescent ADHD faces implementation challenges in real-world settings. The purpose of this trial was to investigate the relationship between implementation fidelity and outcomes among adolescents receiving services in the active treatment arm (N = 114; Motivational Interviewing [MI]-enhanced parent-teen behavior therapy) of a community-based randomized trial of adolescent ADHD treatment. Participants received therapy from community clinicians (N = 44) at four agencies in a large, ethnically diverse metropolitan setting. Therapists provided self-report of session-by-session adherence to content fidelity checklists and audio recordings of sample sessions that were coded for MI integrity. Parents provided report of ADHD symptoms and family impairment at baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up, while academic records were obtained directly from the local school district. Results indicated that content fidelity significantly waned across the 10 manualized sessions (d = -1.23); these trends were steepest when therapy was delivered outside the office-setting and parent attendance was low. Community therapist self-report of content fidelity predicted significantly greater improvements in academic impairment from baseline to follow-up. MI delivery quality was not associated with improved outcomes; contrary to hypotheses, lower MI relational scores predicted significantly greater improvements in family impairment over time. Findings indicate that community-based outcomes for evidence-based ADHD treatment are enhanced when treatment is implemented with fidelity. Future work should revise community-based implementation strategies for adolescent ADHD treatment to prevent declines in fidelity over time, thereby improving outcomes.
