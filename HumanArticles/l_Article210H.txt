Purpose: The purpose of the cross-sectional observational cohort study was to quantify movement patterns and neuromuscular impairments in Olympic Female Field Hockey utilizing a standardized movement-centered assessment model.

Methodology/sample: A sample of convenience was obtained from the active roster of the 2016 USA Women's Olympic Field Hockey team. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and resulted in nine participants. The study was conducted over 1 session in which each athlete was tested using the SFMA™, Y Balance Test Lower Quarter (YBT-LQ™) FMS™, and closed chain dorsiflexion range of motion (CKCDFROM). Injury risk assignment was generated based on an evidenced based algorithm. Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions were applied to the subjects.

Results: Injury risk stratification was applied to the subjects with 44% being at moderate risk and 56% at slight risk. 100% of the athletes exhibited spinal extension deficits and 89% of the athletes displayed a dysfunctional single leg stance pattern. Regional impairments included the following observations: anterior hip mobility deficits (5/9 subjects) and rolling motor control dysfunction (7/9 subjects).

Implications: A battery of movement centered tests combined with an evidenced based algorithm can provide meaningful information informing future programming for the elite female athlete. Considering regional interdependence applications, impairments at the hip and thoracic spine, combined with poor quality of movement in extension could create undue stress in remote regions of the spine and lower quarter, thus contributing to injury risk for the spine and lower quarter.
