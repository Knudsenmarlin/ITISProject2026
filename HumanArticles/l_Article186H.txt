Introduction and objectives: Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a prevalent valve disease with a high mortality rate. Current guidelines do not define specific thresholds at which patients should be considered for surgery or percutaneous procedures. Thus, patients are usually referred for intervention at a late stage of the disease. This study aimed to assess predictors of cardiovascular outcomes in a prospective cohort of patients with severe TR referred for surgery.

Methods: This was an observational, prospective, nonrandomized study. All patients underwent surgery for severe TR based on current clinical guidelines. Complete anamnesis, blood test, echocardiogram, cardiovascular magnetic resonance and right and left catheterization were performed. Patients were followed up in the outpatient department and a combined endpoint (hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality) was registered.

Results: Forty-three consecutive patients were included (age: 66.9 ± 9.6 years, 67.4% female). Tricuspid annuloplasty was performed in all patients. After a median follow-up of 38 months, 12 patients (27.9%) showed the combined endpoint and 7 (16.3%) died. Above all clinical, blood and imaging data, the indexed right ventricular end-diastolic volume constituted the best predictor of the combined endpoint (HR, 1.1; P = .02) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.1; P = .05). Furthermore, indexed right ventricular end-diastolic volume was associated with TR recurrence after surgery, with no impact on clinical outcomes.

Conclusions: In patients with severe TR referred for surgery, right ventricular remodeling assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance constituted the best independent predictor of cardiovascular outcomes at follow-up.
