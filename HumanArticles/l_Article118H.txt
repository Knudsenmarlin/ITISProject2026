Disorders in the child's neurological development caused by perinatal risks can lead to long-term altered neurological signs that begin at an early age and involve persistent functional disorders. Recent data suggest that tissue dysfunction, not just acute damage, may initiate or perpetuate an inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to find out if any neurological dysfunction in preschool children secondary to damage generated during the perinatal period is associated with the magnitude of perinatal risks and long-term modifications in the serum concentrations of inflammatory molecules. The participants, aged 1-4 years, were on neurodevelopmental follow-up and rehabilitation therapy from the first three months of life and had no acute disease data. We classified the children into three groups according to the importance of their perinatal risks: low, medium, and high. The results show that 1) the magnitude of perinatal risks correlated with the severity of neurological dysfunction; 2) the greatest changes in the concentrations of the molecules of the inflammatory process were associated with the most altered neurological signs. This suggests that persistent nervous system dysfunction keeps inflammatory responses active even in the absence of an acute process of infection or damage.
