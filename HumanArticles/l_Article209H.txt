Introduction: Daytime tiredness is a risk factor for poor health and well-being in the short and long term and is often associated with sleep problems, stress-related mental health complaints and decreased school functioning. This study investigates the effect of an 8 month dance intervention study on daytime tiredness, alertness, sleep duration, sleep quality and school satisfaction.

Methods: Randomized controlled intervention study that included a total of 112 girls aged 13-18 years old with stress-related somatic and mental health problems. Dance intervention with focus on enjoyment were performed semiweekly for 8 months. Questionnaire-based measurements regarding self-reported daytime tiredness, alertness, school satisfaction, sleep duration and quality were evaluated at baseline and at 8-, 12- and 20- month follow-ups.

Results: Daytime tiredness decreased significantly in the dance group compared to control group at all follow-ups. Alertness increased significant within the dance group, but there were no significant difference compared to the controls. Significant improvements were found in all sleep quality items within the dance group, between groups only one significant result was found. No conclusive changes in sleep duration were observed. School satisfaction increased significantly in the dance intervention group; however, its significance compared to that of the control group faded after adjustment for differences between groups at baseline.

Conclusions: This study suggests that a dance intervention focusing on enjoyment can be effective in decreasing daytime tiredness. This study also adds to the growing body of evidence for the benefits of using nonpharmacological interventions to decrease stress-related problems among adolescents.
