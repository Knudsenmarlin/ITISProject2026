Objective: Evaluate the relationship between ambient temperature, relative humidity and particulate matter 2,5 with the number of cases Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome in Chile between 2015 and 2017.

Methods: Observational, cross-sectional study in 197 cases of Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome reported and confirmed, occurring between 2015 and 2017 in Chile.

Results: Positive and significant relationship was identified between ambient temperature and number of cases of Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome and a negative and significant relationship between the number of cases Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome and the relative humidity. Also, ambient temperature together with particulate matter 2,5 was observed to increase significantly the number of cases of Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome.

Conclusions: Environmental factors are related to the number of cases Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in Chile between the years 2015 to 2017.
