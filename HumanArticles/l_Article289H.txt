Objective: Describe the clinical-surgical and sociodemographic characteristics of patients with esophageal atresia (EA) of the Instituto Nacional de Salud del Niño San Borja (INSN-SB) during 2015-2017.

Material and methods: Descriptive observational study of cases with EA 2015-2017. The data was processed and analyzed in the SPSS v20 program, the absolute and relative frequency distributions were expressed in tables.

Results: 74 cases with AE were analyzed, 55.4% (n=41) were male. According to gestational age, 45 were at term, 28 pre-term and one post-term. 59.5% had adequate weight at birth. Only 28.4% had complete prenatal care (CPN). 68.9% did not have a prenatal diagnosis of AE. Atresia with distal tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) was the most frequent in 74.3% (n=55). Hypersalivation occurred in 55 patients (74.3%), followed by dyspnea in 54 (72.9%). Cardiac malformations predominated in 27.1%, followed by digestive 20.3% and genitourinary 17.6%. Only 26 had associated syndromes, VACTERL in 12 cases. End-to-end anastomosis and fistula closure were performed in 55 patients (74.3%). 48 presented early complications, predominating sepsis (20.3%) and 46 late complications, with gastroesophageal reflux being the most frequent 29.7%. Regarding mortality, 8 (10.8%) died.

Conclusions: Most of the cases were male, at term, with adequate weight at birth and without CPN. AE with distal TEF was the most frequent. Sialorrhea and dyspnea were the predominant symptoms and cardiac and digestive malformations the most associated. End-to-end anastomosis surgery and fistula closure was the most frequent technique. Complications were sepsis and gastroesophageal reflux. Mortality was low.
