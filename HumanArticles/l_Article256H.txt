Objectives: To determine the incidence density, risk factors and common pathogens associated with surgical site infections (SSI) following lower segment caesarean section (LSCS) surgeries.

Methods: In this Non-interventional prospective observational study, a total of 611 post caesarean emergency and elective cases were enrolled among the 1018 LSCS cases conducted for the period of May-August 2016. The demographic, risk factors and clinical data for appearance of signs and symptoms of SSI were recorded in a preformatted proforma. SSI's were classified as superficial, deep and organ space as per Centre for Disease Control (CDC), USA definitions. Pus specimens were processed and antimicrobial susceptibility results of the organisms were determined as standard microbiological techniques.

Results: The SSI rate was found to be 10.3 per 100 surgeries in our study with superficial SSI (66.7%) being most common. Inappropriate pre-surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, anaemia, previous LSCS as indication of LSCS, intra-operative blood transfusion and comorbid illness like heart disease, hypothyroidism, chronic liver and kidney disease were found to be significantly associated with SSI. Predominance of gram negative isolates (55.3%) was seen in comparison to gram positive isolates (44.7%) as cause of surgical site infections.

Conclusions: SSIs rates observed are much higher than those observed in NHSN participating hospitals. Many of the risk factors identified are low hanging fruits and can be targeted to effectively reduce SSI rates.
