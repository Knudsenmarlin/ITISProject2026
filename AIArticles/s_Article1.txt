Title: The Efficacy and Safety of a Novel Dual-Action GLP-1/GIP Receptor Agonist (DA-209) versus Placebo in the Management of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD): A Phase IIb, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial

Abstract (Structured)
Background & Aims: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver disease globally, with no approved pharmacotherapy. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists show benefit, but emerging data suggests added efficacy with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor co-agonism. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of DA-209, a novel dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, in patients with MASLD and significant fibrosis.
Methods: In this multicenter, Phase IIb trial, 246 adults with biopsy-confirmed MASLD (NAFLD Activity Score [NAS] ≥4, Fibrosis stage F2-F3) were randomized 2:1 to receive once-weekly subcutaneous DA-209 (titrated to 4.5 mg) or placebo for 72 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a ≥30% relative reduction in hepatic fat fraction (HFF) measured by MRI-Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF) at Week 72. Key secondary endpoints included improvement in histological features (NAS reduction ≥2 points without worsening fibrosis), fibrosis regression (≥1 stage), and changes in body weight, HbA1c, and liver enzymes.
Results: At Week 72, 67.1% of patients in the DA-209 group achieved ≥30% HFF reduction vs. 14.6% with placebo (p<0.0001). Absolute mean HFF reduction was -8.2%±3.1% with DA-209 vs. -0.9%±2.8% with placebo (p<0.0001). Histologic improvement (NAS reduction ≥2) occurred in 54.3% vs. 18.3% (p<0.0001). Fibrosis improvement (≥1 stage) was observed in 41.5% of the DA-209 group vs. 19.5% in the placebo group (p=0.003). DA-209 led to significant reductions in body weight (-10.2% vs. -1.5%), HbA1c (-1.2% vs. -0.1%), and ALT levels. The most common adverse events with DA-209 were transient, mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal events (nausea: 31%, diarrhea: 22%). No drug-related serious adverse events were reported.
Conclusions: DA-209, a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, demonstrated superior efficacy over placebo in reducing hepatic steatosis, improving liver histology, and inducing fibrosis regression in patients with significant MASLD over a 72-week period, with a safety profile consistent with the incretin class. These findings support advancement to Phase III trials.

1. Introduction
Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), represents a spectrum of liver injury ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is intrinsically linked to the metabolic syndrome, with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as major drivers. Its global prevalence is estimated at 25-30%, making it a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and a significant public health burden.

The pathophysiological hallmark is hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) triggered by insulin resistance, leading to lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation, which in turn promote hepatocyte injury, apoptosis, and activation of hepatic stellate cells, culminating in fibrosis. Despite its prevalence, therapeutic options remain limited to lifestyle interventions, with no pharmacotherapies currently approved by major regulatory agencies.

Incretin-based therapies, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), have revolutionized T2DM and obesity management. Their mechanisms—promoting glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon, delaying gastric emptying, and centrally mediating satiety—directly target key metabolic disturbances in MASLD. Several GLP-1 RAs have shown promise in reducing hepatic fat and improving histology in Phase II trials. However, the magnitude of effect on fibrosis, the critical determinant of long-term outcomes, has been modest.

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is the other major incretin hormone. Initially considered a potential obesogenic agent, recent evidence paradoxically suggests that GIP receptor agonism, particularly when combined with GLP-1, may enhance metabolic efficacy and weight loss. Preclinical models indicate that dual GLP-1/GIP agonism improves hepatic steatosis and inflammation more potently than selective GLP-1 RAs, potentially through enhanced insulin sensitization in adipose tissue and direct anti-inflammatory effects on hepatocytes and macrophages.

DA-209 is a novel, once-weekly, subcutaneous peptide agonist engineered with balanced activity at both the human GLP-1 and GIP receptors. This Phase IIb trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DA-209 specifically in patients with MASLD and significant (stage F2-F3) fibrosis, a population at high risk for progression, over a treatment period of 72 weeks.

2. Methods
2.1. Study Design and Oversight
This was a Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial conducted at 45 tertiary care centers across North America and Europe. The trial comprised a 4-week screening period, a 4-week dose-escalation phase, a 68-week maintenance phase (total treatment: 72 weeks), and a 4-week safety follow-up. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each site and conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.

2.2. Participants
Eligible patients were adults aged 18-75 years with a body-mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m². Key inclusion criteria were: 1) Histologically confirmed MASLD on a biopsy performed within 24 months of screening, with a NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) of ≥4 (with at least 1 point each for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning) and fibrosis stage F2 or F3 (according to the NASH CRN system). 2) Hepatic fat fraction (HFF) ≥10% as assessed by centrally read MRI-PDFF at screening. Key exclusion criteria included: other causes of liver disease (viral hepatitis, autoimmunity, significant alcohol intake), cirrhosis (F4), history of hepatic decompensation, uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c >9.5%), use of approved or investigational drugs for MASLD (e.g., vitamin E, pioglitazone) within 6 months, and previous bariatric surgery.

2.3. Randomization and Masking
Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either DA-209 or matching placebo. Randomization was stratified by diabetes status (present/absent) and fibrosis stage (F2/F3), using a centralized interactive web-response system. All participants, investigators, study site personnel, and the sponsor’s clinical team were blinded to treatment assignment throughout the trial. The placebo was identical in appearance, packaging, and administration schedule.

2.4. Procedures and Intervention
DA-209 and placebo were supplied in prefilled single-dose pens for subcutaneous injection. The dose was escalated weekly (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 2.0 mg, 3.0 mg) over 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 4.5 mg, administered once weekly. Patients were instructed to inject in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Adherence was monitored via returned pen logs and diary entries. All patients received standardized lifestyle counseling on diet and physical activity at each visit.

2.5. Endpoints
Primary Endpoint: The proportion of patients achieving a ≥30% relative reduction from baseline in HFF as measured by MRI-PDFF at Week 72.
Key Secondary Endpoints:

Histological response: Proportion achieving a ≥2-point reduction in NAS with no worsening of fibrosis.

Fibrosis response: Proportion achieving a ≥1-stage reduction in fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis.

Change from baseline in absolute HFF (%) by MRI-PDFF.

Resolution of steatohepatitis: NAS of 0-1 for inflammation, 0 for ballooning, and any grade of steatosis.

Change from baseline in body weight, HbA1c, fasting glucose, and liver enzymes (ALT, AST).
Exploratory Endpoints: Changes in non-invasive biomarkers (ELF test, Pro-C3), lipid profile, and quality-of-life questionnaires.
Safety Endpoints: Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), laboratory abnormalities, vital signs, and pancreatic/lipase/amylase levels.

2.6. Assessments
Liver Biopsy & Histology: A liver biopsy was performed at screening (if a recent qualifying biopsy was unavailable) and repeated at Week 72. All biopsy samples were assessed centrally by two expert hepatopathologists blinded to treatment, time point, and patient data, using the NASH CRN scoring system.
MRI-PDFF: Performed at baseline, Week 24, Week 48, and Week 72 at certified imaging centers using standardized protocols, with centralized analysis.
Clinical & Laboratory Assessments: Body weight, vital signs, fasting blood samples (for chemistry, hematology, HbA1c, lipids, specific biomarkers) were collected at regular intervals.

2.7. Statistical Analysis
The sample size was calculated based on the primary endpoint. Assuming a response rate of 15% in the placebo group and 40% in the DA-209 group, with 90% power and a two-sided alpha of 0.05, and accounting for a 15% dropout rate, 246 patients (164 in DA-209, 82 in placebo) were required.
Efficacy analyses were performed on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and had a baseline and at least one post-baseline MRI-PDFF assessment. The primary endpoint was analyzed using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test, adjusted for stratification factors. Continuous variables were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose. All statistical tests were two-sided, with a significance level of 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Patient Disposition and Baseline Characteristics
Between [Date] and [Date], 328 patients were screened, and 246 were randomized (164 to DA-209, 82 to placebo). The mITT population comprised 155 patients in the DA-209 group and 78 in the placebo group. Overall, 84.1% of patients in the DA-209 group and 80.5% in the placebo group completed the 72-week treatment period. The most common reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent and adverse events.
Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between groups. The mean age was 54.2 years, 58% were male, mean BMI was 35.4 kg/m², 62% had T2DM, mean HbA1c was 7.4%, mean HFF was 18.7%, and the distribution of fibrosis stages (F2/F3) was approximately 65%/35%.

3.2. Efficacy Outcomes
Primary Endpoint: At Week 72, 104 of 155 patients (67.1%) in the DA-209 group achieved a ≥30% relative reduction in HFF, compared with 11 of 78 patients (14.1%) in the placebo group (adjusted difference: 53.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 42.1 to 63.9; p<0.0001).
Hepatic Fat Reduction (MRI-PDFF): The mean absolute reduction in HFF was -8.2% ± 3.1% in the DA-209 group versus -0.9% ± 2.8% in the placebo group (p<0.0001). Significant reductions were evident as early as Week 24.
Histological Outcomes: Among patients with paired biopsies (n=138 for DA-209, n=68 for placebo):
- A ≥2-point NAS reduction without fibrosis worsening was achieved in 75 patients (54.3%) with DA-209 vs. 12 (17.6%) with placebo (p<0.0001).
- Fibrosis improvement (≥1 stage) without worsening of steatohepatitis was achieved in 57 patients (41.3%) with DA-209 vs. 13 (19.1%) with placebo (p=0.003).
- Steatohepatitis resolution was observed in 43 patients (31.2%) with DA-209 vs. 5 (7.4%) with placebo (p<0.0001).
Metabolic and Biochemical Parameters:
- Body Weight: DA-209 produced a mean percent weight loss of -10.2% ± 3.8% vs. -1.5% ± 3.2% with placebo (p<0.0001).
- HbA1c: Reduced by -1.2% ± 0.6% vs. -0.1% ± 0.5% (p<0.0001).
- ALT: Reduced by -35.2 U/L ± 18.4 U/L vs. -8.1 U/L ± 15.7 U/L (p<0.0001).

3.3. Safety Outcomes
The incidence of any AE was similar between groups (DA-209: 86.6%, Placebo: 84.1%). However, gastrointestinal AEs, predominantly mild or moderate, were more frequent with DA-209: nausea (31.1% vs. 9.8%), diarrhea (21.6% vs. 8.5%), and vomiting (12.8% vs. 2.4%). These events were most common during dose escalation and typically resolved within 4-8 weeks.
Serious AEs occurred in 8.5% of the DA-209 group and 7.3% of the placebo group; none were deemed drug-related by the investigators. There were no cases of confirmed pancreatitis, adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), or symptomatic hypoglycemia requiring assistance. No significant differences were observed in heart rate, blood pressure, or rates of pancreatic enzyme elevation between groups. One patient in the DA-209 group discontinued due to persistent moderate nausea.

4. Discussion
This Phase IIb trial demonstrates that 72 weeks of treatment with the novel dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist DA-209 results in clinically significant and superior improvements across multiple domains of MASLD compared with placebo, in a high-risk population with significant fibrosis.

The primary endpoint result—a 67% rate of substantial hepatic fat reduction—is notably higher than rates reported in similar-duration trials of selective GLP-1 RAs (typically 40-60%). This suggests an additive effect of GIP receptor agonism, potentially through enhanced insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, leading to reduced flux of free fatty acids to the liver, and/or direct hepatic effects. The profound reductions in HFF were corroborated by histology, with over half of the treated patients showing meaningful improvement in disease activity (NAS).

Most critically, fibrosis improvement of at least one stage was achieved in 41% of DA-209-treated patients, a rate that appears numerically higher than those reported for selective GLP-1 RAs in comparable populations. This is a key finding, as fibrosis stage is the strongest predictor of liver-related mortality in MASLD. While the exact mechanism remains speculative, it likely involves a combination of reduced hepatocyte injury (via less steatosis and lipotoxicity), dampened hepatic inflammation, and potentially direct modulation of stellate cell activity by the incretin hormones.

The metabolic benefits were robust, with double-digit percentage weight loss and significant HbA1c reduction, aligning with the known pharmacology of incretin therapies and addressing core drivers of MASLD. The safety and tolerability profile was manageable and consistent with the drug class, dominated by transient GI effects. The absence of pancreatitis or MACE signals is reassuring, though longer-term, larger studies are required for definitive cardiovascular and pancreatic safety.

Limitations: The 72-week duration, while longer than many Phase II studies, is insufficient to assess long-term outcomes like progression to cirrhosis or need for transplantation. The requirement for liver biopsy, while a strength for endpoint assessment, limits generalizability and contributed to screening failures. The study population, though high-risk, excluded patients with cirrhosis (F4), for whom effective therapies are urgently needed.
Future Directions: The results strongly support the initiation of Phase III trials with clinical outcome assessments (e.g., progression to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation). Future studies should also explore combinations with other mechanistic agents (e.g., FXR agonists, ACC inhibitors) and include more diverse patient populations.

5. Conclusion
In patients with MASLD and significant fibrosis, treatment with the dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist DA-209 for 72 weeks resulted in significantly greater reductions in hepatic steatosis, improvements in liver histology including fibrosis regression, and substantial metabolic benefits compared with placebo, with a favorable safety profile. DA-209 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for a disease with vast unmet need and warrants further investigation in definitive Phase III clinical trials.
