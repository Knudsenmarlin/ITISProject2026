\f1\b\fs48 \cf0 \strokec2 Effect of Aerobic Exercise on Glycemic Control and Cardiovascular Risk Markers in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\fs36 \cf0 Abstract\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Background:
\f0\b0  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle interventions, including aerobic exercise, are recommended for glycemic control, yet the optimal exercise prescription and effects on cardiovascular risk markers require further study.\

\f1\b Objective:
\f0\b0  To evaluate the effects of a 12-week supervised aerobic exercise program on glycemic control, body composition, lipid profile, and blood pressure in adults with T2DM.\

\f1\b Methods:
\f0\b0  This randomized controlled trial enrolled 120 adults aged 40\'9665 years with T2DM, HbA1c 6.5\'969.0%, and BMI 25\'9635 kg/m\'b2. Participants were randomly assigned to either an aerobic exercise group (AE, n = 60) or control group receiving standard diabetes education (CON, n = 60). The AE group participated in supervised moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (treadmill or cycling) 5 days per week, 45 minutes per session, for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were fasting blood glucose and HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included body weight, waist circumference, BMI, lipid profile, and blood pressure.\

\f1\b Results:
\f0\b0  At 12 weeks, the AE group demonstrated a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose (\uc0\u8722 20.4 \'b1 12.3 mg/dL) compared to CON (\u8722 4.1 \'b1 11.5 mg/dL, p < 0.001). HbA1c decreased by \u8722 0.9 \'b1 0.5% in AE versus \u8722 0.2 \'b1 0.4% in CON (p < 0.001). The AE group lost an average of 3.8 \'b1 2.1 kg, with a reduction in waist circumference of 3.2 \'b1 1.5 cm, significantly greater than CON (p < 0.01). Total cholesterol and triglycerides decreased by 12.5 \'b1 8.7 mg/dL and 15.7 \'b1 10.2 mg/dL, respectively, in AE, while remaining unchanged in controls. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly in the AE group (\u8722 8.3 \'b1 5.1 mmHg and \u8722 5.6 \'b1 3.9 mmHg, respectively; p < 0.01). No adverse events were reported.\

\f1\b Conclusions:
\f0\b0  A 12-week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program improves glycemic control, body composition, lipid profile, and blood pressure in adults with T2DM. Regular aerobic exercise is an effective non-pharmacological strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk and enhance metabolic health in this population.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Introduction\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired pancreatic \uc0\u946 -cell function, leading to persistent hyperglycemia. Individuals with T2DM are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Glycemic control and cardiovascular risk reduction are key objectives in T2DM management.\
Lifestyle interventions, particularly aerobic exercise, play a critical role in improving insulin sensitivity, reducing adiposity, and lowering cardiovascular risk. Aerobic exercise enhances skeletal muscle glucose uptake, increases cardiorespiratory fitness, and favorably modifies lipid profiles and blood pressure. Despite established recommendations for physical activity in T2DM, adherence is often suboptimal, and the magnitude of metabolic improvement with structured programs varies.\
Prior studies suggest that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise performed regularly can reduce fasting glucose and HbA1c, yet evidence regarding changes in lipid profile, body composition, and blood pressure is heterogeneous. Furthermore, many studies are limited by small sample sizes, short duration, or lack of supervised interventions.\
This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effects of a 12-week supervised moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program on glycemic control, body composition, lipid profile, and blood pressure in adults with T2DM. We hypothesized that participants undergoing aerobic exercise would achieve significant improvements in fasting glucose, HbA1c, and cardiovascular risk markers compared to controls receiving standard care.\

\fs28 \cf0 Study Design and Participants\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This single-center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial recruited adults aged 40\'9665 years with T2DM from outpatient endocrinology clinics. Inclusion criteria were: T2DM diagnosed for at least 1 year, HbA1c 6.5\'969.0%, BMI 25\'9635 kg/m\'b2, and stable oral hypoglycemic therapy for \uc0\u8805 3 months.\
Exclusion criteria included: insulin therapy, recent cardiovascular events, uncontrolled hypertension (>160/100 mmHg), severe musculoskeletal limitations, pregnancy, or participation in regular structured exercise (>2 sessions/week) within the prior 3 months.\
Eligible participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional review board.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to AE or CON using a computer-generated sequence, stratified by sex and baseline HbA1c. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. Participants could not be blinded due to the nature of the intervention.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Intervention\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Aerobic Exercise (AE) Group:
\f0\b0  Participants attended supervised moderate-intensity aerobic sessions (treadmill walking or stationary cycling) 5 days per week, 45 minutes per session, for 12 weeks. Exercise intensity was set at 60\'9670% of heart rate reserve, monitored using heart rate monitors. Participants were encouraged to maintain usual dietary habits.\

\f1\b Control (CON) Group:
\f0\b0  Participants received standard diabetes education, including dietary guidance, physical activity recommendations, and glucose monitoring instructions. No structured exercise was prescribed.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This study demonstrates that a 12-week supervised moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program significantly improves glycemic control, body composition, lipid profile, and blood pressure in adults with T2DM. Reductions in fasting glucose (\uc0\u8722 20 mg/dL) and HbA1c (\u8722 0.9%) are clinically meaningful and comparable to pharmacologic interventions.\
Weight loss, decreased waist circumference, and modest improvements in HDL and LDL cholesterol contribute to reduced cardiovascular risk. Blood pressure reductions observed in AE suggest additional cardiovascular protection. The high adherence and lack of adverse events indicate feasibility and safety of structured aerobic exercise in this population.\
Mechanistically, aerobic exercise enhances skeletal muscle glucose uptake, increases insulin sensitivity, reduces visceral adiposity, and improves endothelial function. Regular exercise also favorably modulates lipid metabolism and systemic inflammation, contributing to reduced cardiovascular risk.\
Limitations include the single-center design, short intervention period, and inability to blind participants. Long-term sustainability of benefits, interactions with pharmacotherapy, and effects of combined aerobic and resistance training require further study.\
