\f1\b\fs48 \cf0 \strokec2 Gut Microbiome Diversity and Depressive Symptoms in Adults: A Cross-Sectional Clinical Study\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\fs36 \cf0 Abstract\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Background:
\f0\b0  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with complex and multifactorial pathophysiology. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut\'96brain axis, particularly the intestinal microbiome, plays a role in mood regulation, neuroinflammation, and stress response. Alterations in gut microbiome composition have been observed in individuals with depressive symptoms; however, clinical data linking microbiome diversity to depression severity remain limited.\

\f1\b Objective:
\f0\b0  To investigate the association between gut microbiome diversity and depressive symptom severity in a cohort of adults.\

\f1\b Methods:
\f0\b0  A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 260 adults aged 20\'9660 years. Participants underwent clinical assessment for depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Stool samples were collected for gut microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity metrics were calculated, and associations between microbiome diversity, specific bacterial taxa, and depressive symptom severity were analyzed using multivariate regression models adjusted for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors.\

\f1\b Results:
\f0\b0  Participants with moderate to severe depressive symptoms exhibited significantly lower gut microbiome alpha diversity compared to those with minimal symptoms (Shannon index: 3.1 vs. 3.8, p < 0.001). Reduced abundance of short-chain fatty acid\'96producing bacteria, including 
\f2\i Faecalibacterium
\f0\i0  and 
\f2\i Roseburia
\f0\i0 , was observed in participants with higher PHQ-9 scores. Lower microbial diversity was independently associated with greater depressive symptom severity after adjustment for confounders.\

\f1\b Conclusion:
\f0\b0  Reduced gut microbiome diversity is significantly associated with increased depressive symptom severity in adults. These findings support a potential role of the gut microbiome in the pathophysiology of depression and highlight the microbiome as a potential target for novel therapeutic strategies.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Introduction\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Depression is a common and debilitating mental health disorder affecting more than 280 million people globally. It is characterized by persistent low mood, anhedonia, cognitive impairment, and somatic symptoms that significantly impair quality of life. Despite extensive research, the biological mechanisms underlying depression are not fully understood, and existing treatments are ineffective or poorly tolerated in a substantial proportion of patients.\
Traditionally, depression has been conceptualized as a disorder of neurotransmitter imbalance; however, contemporary models emphasize the role of neuroinflammation, hypothalamic\'96pituitary\'96adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, and immune system activation. In recent years, the gut\'96brain axis has emerged as a critical pathway linking peripheral physiological processes to central nervous system function.\
The human gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms that play essential roles in digestion, immune modulation, and metabolic regulation. These microorganisms also produce neuroactive compounds, including serotonin precursors, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and short-chain fatty acids, which can influence brain function through neural, immune, and endocrine pathways.\
Animal studies have demonstrated that alterations in gut microbiota composition can induce depression-like behaviors, while fecal microbiota transplantation from depressed individuals can reproduce these behaviors in germ-free rodents. Human studies have reported differences in microbiome composition between individuals with depression and healthy controls; however, findings are inconsistent, and many studies are limited by small sample sizes or lack of clinical phenotyping.\
This study aims to examine the association between gut microbiome diversity and depressive symptom severity in a well-characterized adult population, controlling for relevant lifestyle and clinical confounders.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Of the 260 participants, 248 provided complete clinical and microbiome data. The mean age was 38.4 \'b1 10.7 years, and 55% were female. Thirty-four percent of participants met criteria for moderate to severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 \uc0\u8805 10).\
Baseline demographic and lifestyle characteristics were similar across depression severity groups, although participants with higher PHQ-9 scores reported lower physical activity levels and higher perceived stress.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Discussion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This study demonstrates a significant association between reduced gut microbiome diversity and increased depressive symptom severity in adults. Individuals with moderate to severe depressive symptoms exhibited lower microbial diversity and altered taxonomic composition, characterized by reduced abundance of beneficial short-chain fatty acid\'96producing bacteria.\
Short-chain fatty acids, particularly butyrate, play a crucial role in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, regulating immune responses, and modulating neuroinflammation. Reduced production of these metabolites may contribute to systemic inflammation and altered neurotransmitter signaling, mechanisms implicated in depression pathophysiology.\
The observed increase in potentially pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa further supports the hypothesis that dysbiosis may promote low-grade inflammation, which has been consistently linked to depressive symptoms. These findings align with previous animal and human studies suggesting bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system.\
Strengths of this study include comprehensive clinical phenotyping, adjustment for multiple confounders, and detailed microbiome analysis. Limitations include the cross-sectional design, which precludes causal inference, and reliance on self-reported depressive symptoms rather than diagnostic interviews.\
Future longitudinal and interventional studies are needed to determine whether modifying the gut microbiome through dietary interventions, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation can improve depressive symptoms.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Reduced gut microbiome diversity is significantly associated with increased depressive symptom severity in adults. These findings support the involvement of the gut\'96brain axis in depression and suggest that microbiome-targeted interventions may represent a promising adjunctive approach in depression management.\
