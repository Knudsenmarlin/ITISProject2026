\f1\b\fs48 \cf0 \strokec2 The Effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on Blood Pressure and Psychological Well-Being in Adults with Prehypertension: A Randomized Controlled Trial\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\fs36 \cf0 Abstract\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Background:
\f0\b0  Prehypertension is a prevalent condition that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Psychological stress is a known contributor to elevated blood pressure, and interventions targeting stress reduction may help mitigate progression to hypertension. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured program designed to reduce stress and improve psychological well-being, but its effects on blood pressure in adults with prehypertension remain incompletely characterized.\

\f1\b Objective:
\f0\b0  To evaluate the effects of an 8-week MBSR program on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, stress, anxiety, and quality of life in adults with prehypertension.\

\f1\b Methods:
\f0\b0  This randomized controlled trial enrolled 120 adults aged 30\'9665 years with prehypertension (systolic BP 120\'96139 mmHg or diastolic BP 80\'9689 mmHg). Participants were randomly assigned to either an MBSR group (n = 60) or a control group receiving standard lifestyle advice (n = 60). The MBSR program included weekly 2-hour sessions and daily home practice. Outcomes measured at baseline and 8 weeks included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI), and quality of life (SF-36). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA.\

\f1\b Results:
\f0\b0  After 8 weeks, the MBSR group demonstrated significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (\uc0\u8722 7.5 \'b1 5.2 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (\u8722 5.1 \'b1 3.8 mmHg) compared to the control group (\u8722 1.2 \'b1 4.5 mmHg and \u8722 0.8 \'b1 3.5 mmHg, respectively; p < 0.001). Perceived stress scores decreased by 8.3 \'b1 4.6 points, and anxiety scores decreased by 6.1 \'b1 3.8 points in the MBSR group, significantly greater than in controls (p < 0.001). SF-36 physical and mental component scores improved by 9.2 \'b1 3.5 and 7.8 \'b1 3.2 points, respectively, in the MBSR group (p < 0.001). No adverse events were reported.\

\f1\b Conclusions:
\f0\b0  An 8-week MBSR program effectively reduces blood pressure, stress, and anxiety while improving quality of life in adults with prehypertension. MBSR may serve as a non-pharmacological intervention to prevent progression to hypertension.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Introduction\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Prehypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 120\'96139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 80\'9689 mmHg, affects a substantial portion of the adult population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although lifestyle modifications such as diet, physical activity, and weight management are recommended, psychological stress is an underappreciated contributor to elevated blood pressure. Chronic stress activates the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in increased vascular tone, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction.\
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is an 8-week program incorporating meditation, body scanning, and mindful movement, developed to improve emotional regulation and reduce stress. Previous studies in hypertensive and general populations suggest that MBSR may lower blood pressure, reduce anxiety, and improve quality of life. However, evidence specifically targeting adults with prehypertension is limited. Understanding whether MBSR can effectively lower blood pressure in this population is important for preventive cardiovascular strategies.\
This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an 8-week MBSR program on blood pressure, psychological stress, anxiety, and quality of life in adults with prehypertension. We hypothesized that MBSR would significantly reduce SBP and DBP and improve psychological well-being compared to a control group receiving standard lifestyle advice.\

\fs28 \cf0 Study Design and Participants\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This was a single-center, randomized controlled trial conducted over 8 weeks. Adults aged 30\'9665 years with prehypertension were recruited from community health clinics. Prehypertension was defined as SBP 120\'96139 mmHg or DBP 80\'9689 mmHg, confirmed by the average of three seated readings on two separate occasions.\
Exclusion criteria included: history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal or hepatic disease, psychiatric disorders requiring pharmacological treatment, current participation in structured stress reduction programs, pregnancy, and use of antihypertensive medications. All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Randomization and Blinding\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the MBSR group or the control group using a computer-generated randomization sequence. Randomization was stratified by sex and baseline SBP. Assessors measuring outcomes were blinded to group allocation. Participants were aware of the intervention due to the nature of MBSR.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Interventions\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 MBSR Group:
\f0\b0  Participants attended weekly 2-hour group sessions for 8 weeks led by a certified instructor. Sessions included guided meditation, body scanning, mindful movement, and group discussion. Participants were instructed to practice mindfulness exercises at home for 30\'9645 minutes daily using audio recordings.\

\f1\b Control Group:
\f0\b0  Participants received standard lifestyle advice for prehypertension, including guidance on diet, physical activity, and sleep hygiene, without structured stress reduction practices.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Statistical Analysis\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Sample size calculation estimated that 50 participants per group would provide 80% power to detect a 5 mmHg difference in SBP between groups, assuming a standard deviation of 8 mmHg and \uc0\u945  = 0.05. To account for potential dropouts, 60 participants per group were recruited.\
Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Continuous variables were expressed as mean \'b1 standard deviation. Between-group differences were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Post hoc analyses were conducted using Bonferroni correction. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Discussion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This study demonstrates that an 8-week MBSR program significantly reduces blood pressure, stress, and anxiety while improving quality of life in adults with prehypertension. The observed reductions in SBP (\uc0\u8722 7.5 mmHg) and DBP (\u8722 5.1 mmHg) are clinically meaningful and may lower cardiovascular risk if sustained long-term.\
The mechanisms underlying these effects likely involve reduction in sympathetic nervous system activity, improved autonomic regulation, and decreased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation. Mindfulness training also enhances emotional regulation and coping skills, contributing to reductions in perceived stress and anxiety.\
Improvements in quality of life, both physical and mental, highlight the broader psychosocial benefits of MBSR. These findings support incorporating mindfulness-based interventions into preventive health strategies for individuals at risk of hypertension.\
Limitations of this study include the relatively short duration and single-center design. Blood pressure measurements were taken in a controlled setting, and long-term effects in real-world conditions remain unknown. Future studies should examine the sustainability of blood pressure reductions, adherence over longer periods, and integration with other lifestyle interventions.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 An 8-week MBSR program effectively reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure, decreases stress and anxiety, and improves quality of life in adults with prehypertension. MBSR offers a safe, non-pharmacological intervention to prevent progression to hypertension and enhance overall psychological well-being. Long-term, multi-center trials are warranted to confirm these findings and evaluate their impact on cardiovascular outcomes.\
