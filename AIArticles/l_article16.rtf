\f1\b\fs48 \cf0 \strokec2 The Effect of a Mediterranean Diet on Glycemic Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Controlled Study\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\fs36 \cf0 Abstract\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Background:
\f0\b0  Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Dietary modification plays a critical role in glycemic control and prevention of complications. The Mediterranean diet has been associated with improved metabolic outcomes, but evidence from randomized controlled studies remains limited.\

\f1\b Objective:
\f0\b0  To evaluate the effects of a Mediterranean diet on glycemic control, lipid profile, and body mass index (BMI) in patients with T2DM.\

\f1\b Methods:
\f0\b0  A 24-week randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 120 adults diagnosed with T2DM. Participants were randomly assigned to either a Mediterranean diet intervention group or a standard diabetic diet control group. Primary outcomes included changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile, BMI, and blood pressure.\

\f1\b Results:
\f0\b0  Participants in the Mediterranean diet group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c levels compared to the control group (\uc0\u8722 1.2% vs. \u8722 0.5%, p < 0.001). Significant improvements were also observed in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and BMI. No serious adverse events were reported.\

\f1\b Conclusion:
\f0\b0  The Mediterranean diet significantly improves glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in patients with T2DM. These findings support the incorporation of Mediterranean dietary patterns into diabetes management guidelines.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Introduction\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, affecting more than 460 million individuals and imposing a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The disease is characterized by insulin resistance and progressive \uc0\u946 -cell dysfunction, leading to chronic hyperglycemia and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy.\
Lifestyle modification, including dietary intervention, remains a cornerstone of T2DM management. While pharmacological therapies are essential, diet has a profound impact on glycemic control and long-term outcomes. Traditional diabetic diets often emphasize calorie restriction and carbohydrate control; however, emerging evidence suggests that dietary patterns may be more important than macronutrient composition alone.\
The Mediterranean diet, characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, olive oil, and moderate intake of fish and poultry, has been associated with reduced cardiovascular risk and improved metabolic health. Observational studies suggest benefits for glycemic control, yet randomized controlled trials assessing its direct impact on patients with established T2DM remain limited.\
This study aims to evaluate the effects of a Mediterranean diet on glycemic control and metabolic parameters in adults with T2DM over a 24-week period.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Participants\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 A total of 120 adults aged 40\'9670 years with a diagnosis of T2DM for at least one year were recruited from outpatient endocrinology clinics.

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Discussion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This randomized controlled study demonstrates that adherence to a Mediterranean diet significantly improves glycemic control and metabolic parameters in patients with T2DM. The observed reduction in HbA1c is clinically meaningful and comparable to the effect of some pharmacological agents.\
Several mechanisms may explain these findings. The high content of monounsaturated fats, dietary fiber, and antioxidants in the Mediterranean diet may enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. Additionally, the emphasis on whole foods and low glycemic index carbohydrates likely contributes to improved postprandial glucose control.\
The improvements in lipid profile observed in this study align with previous research highlighting the cardiovascular benefits of the Mediterranean diet. Given the elevated cardiovascular risk associated with T2DM, these findings are particularly relevant.\
This study has limitations, including its single-center design and reliance on self-reported dietary adherence. Longer follow-up periods are needed to assess sustainability and long-term outcomes.\

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 The Mediterranean diet is an effective and safe dietary intervention for improving glycemic control and reducing cardiovascular risk factors in patients with T2DM. Healthcare providers should consider recommending this dietary pattern as part of comprehensive diabetes management.\
