\f1\b\fs48 \cf0 \strokec2 The Association Between Sleep Duration and Immune Function in Healthy Adults: A Prospective Observational Study\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\fs36 \cf0 Abstract\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Background:
\f0\b0  Sleep is a fundamental physiological process essential for immune system regulation and overall health. Both short and long sleep durations have been associated with adverse health outcomes, including increased susceptibility to infections. However, the relationship between habitual sleep duration and immune biomarkers in healthy adults remains incompletely understood.\

\f1\b Objective:
\f0\b0  To examine the association between sleep duration and immune function, assessed through inflammatory and immunological biomarkers, in a cohort of healthy adults.\

\f1\b Methods:
\f0\b0  A prospective observational study was conducted involving 180 healthy adults aged 25\'9655 years. Participants were categorized into three groups based on self-reported average sleep duration: short sleep (<6 hours), normal sleep (6\'968 hours), and long sleep (>8 hours). Immune function was assessed using serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\uc0\u945 ), and natural killer (NK) cell activity. Data were analyzed using multivariate regression models adjusted for potential confounders.\

\f1\b Results:
\f0\b0  Short sleep duration was significantly associated with elevated CRP, IL-6, and TNF-\uc0\u945  levels and reduced NK cell activity compared to normal sleep duration (p < 0.01). Long sleep duration was also associated with higher inflammatory markers, though to a lesser extent. Normal sleep duration was associated with optimal immune biomarker profiles.\

\f1\b Conclusion:
\f0\b0  Both insufficient and excessive sleep durations are associated with altered immune function in healthy adults. Maintaining a regular sleep duration of 6\'968 hours may support optimal immune health and reduce low-grade systemic inflammation.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Introduction\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Sleep plays a critical role in maintaining physiological homeostasis, cognitive performance, metabolic regulation, and immune competence. Increasing evidence suggests that sleep and immune function are closely interconnected, with bidirectional influences. Immune activation can alter sleep architecture, while sleep deprivation can impair immune responses and increase vulnerability to infectious and inflammatory diseases.\
Modern lifestyles have led to widespread sleep disturbances and reduced sleep duration, particularly among working-age adults. Epidemiological studies have linked short sleep duration to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, depression, and mortality. Conversely, long sleep duration has also been associated with adverse health outcomes, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.\
From an immunological perspective, sleep is thought to enhance host defense by promoting the production of cytokines and facilitating immune cell trafficking. Experimental studies have demonstrated that acute sleep deprivation can reduce natural killer (NK) cell activity and alter cytokine profiles. However, most existing research has focused on acute or experimental sleep deprivation rather than habitual sleep patterns in healthy populations.\
Understanding how regular sleep duration influences immune biomarkers in otherwise healthy individuals may provide valuable insights into disease prevention and public health strategies. This study aims to investigate the association between habitual sleep duration and immune function markers in a cohort of healthy adults.\

\fs28 \cf0 Participant Characteristics\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Of the 180 enrolled participants, 172 completed the study (short sleep: n = 54; normal sleep: n = 78; long sleep: n = 40). Baseline characteristics, including age, sex distribution, BMI, physical activity, and dietary habits, were comparable across groups, although perceived stress levels were slightly higher in the short sleep group.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Inflammatory Markers\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Participants in the short sleep group exhibited significantly higher levels of CRP, IL-6, and TNF-\uc0\u945  compared to the normal sleep group (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). Mean CRP levels were 2.1 \'b1 0.9 mg/L in the short sleep group versus 1.2 \'b1 0.6 mg/L in the normal sleep group.\
The long sleep group also showed elevated inflammatory markers compared to the normal sleep group, though values were lower than those observed in the short sleep group. These differences remained significant after adjusting for BMI, stress, and physical activity.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 NK Cell Activity\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 NK cell activity was significantly reduced in the short sleep group compared to the normal sleep group (p < 0.01). The long sleep group demonstrated intermediate NK cell activity levels, which were lower than normal sleepers but higher than short sleepers.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Multivariate Analysis\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Multivariate regression analysis confirmed that short sleep duration was independently associated with elevated inflammatory markers and reduced NK cell activity after controlling for confounders. Long sleep duration was also independently associated with increased CRP and IL-6 levels, though the associations were weaker.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Discussion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This study demonstrates a significant association between habitual sleep duration and immune function in healthy adults. Short sleep duration was associated with a pro-inflammatory state and impaired innate immune function, as evidenced by elevated inflammatory markers and reduced NK cell activity. These findings support the hypothesis that chronic insufficient sleep may compromise immune defense and increase susceptibility to inflammatory conditions.\
The observed association between long sleep duration and elevated inflammatory markers is consistent with previous epidemiological studies linking excessive sleep to adverse health outcomes. While the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not fully understood, long sleep duration may reflect underlying health issues, reduced physical activity, or altered circadian regulation.\
The biological mechanisms linking sleep and immune function are complex and likely involve neuroendocrine pathways, including dysregulation of cortisol and sympathetic nervous system activity. Sleep loss has been shown to increase pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation.\
Strengths of this study include the assessment of multiple immune biomarkers and adjustment for a wide range of confounding factors. Limitations include reliance on self-reported sleep duration and the observational design, which precludes causal inference. Future studies using objective sleep measurements and longitudinal designs are warranted.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Conclusion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Habitual sleep duration is significantly associated with immune function in healthy adults. Both insufficient and excessive sleep are linked to increased inflammatory markers and altered immune responses. Promoting healthy sleep duration of 6\'968 hours per night may be an important strategy for maintaining optimal immune health and preventing chronic disease.\
