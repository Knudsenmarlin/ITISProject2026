\f1\b\fs48 \cf0 \strokec2 The Impact of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring on Blood Pressure Control in Patients With Essential Hypertension: A Randomized Controlled Study\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\fs36 \cf0 Abstract\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Background:
\f0\b0  Hypertension is a leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite the availability of effective antihypertensive medications, blood pressure control rates remain suboptimal. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) has been proposed as an adjunct to standard care to improve patient engagement and treatment outcomes.\

\f1\b Objective:
\f0\b0  To evaluate the effectiveness of HBPM combined with standard care compared to standard care alone in improving blood pressure control among patients with essential hypertension.\

\f1\b Methods:
\f0\b0  A 6-month randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 160 adults with diagnosed essential hypertension. Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group receiving HBPM plus standard care or a control group receiving standard care alone. Primary outcomes included changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Secondary outcomes included medication adherence, patient satisfaction, and frequency of antihypertensive therapy adjustments.\

\f1\b Results:
\f0\b0  At 6 months, the intervention group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to the control group (\uc0\u8722 14.6/\u8722 8.9 mmHg vs. \u8722 7.2/\u8722 4.1 mmHg; p < 0.001). Medication adherence and patient satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the HBPM group. No serious adverse events were reported.\

\f1\b Conclusion:
\f0\b0  The addition of HBPM to standard care significantly improves blood pressure control, medication adherence, and patient satisfaction in individuals with essential hypertension. HBPM should be considered a valuable component of hypertension management strategies.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Introduction\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Hypertension affects more than 1.2 billion individuals globally and is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal failure, and premature mortality. Despite advances in pharmacological therapy and clinical guidelines, effective blood pressure control remains elusive for a substantial proportion of patients. Factors such as poor medication adherence, inadequate treatment intensification, and limited patient engagement contribute to suboptimal outcomes.\
Traditional blood pressure measurement in clinical settings has several limitations, including white-coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and variability due to measurement conditions. These factors can lead to misclassification and inappropriate treatment decisions. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) offers a practical and accessible alternative that allows for repeated measurements in a familiar environment, potentially providing more accurate representations of a patient\'92s true blood pressure.\
Previous observational studies and meta-analyses suggest that HBPM may improve blood pressure control and adherence to antihypertensive therapy. However, variability in study design and patient populations has limited the generalizability of findings. Furthermore, data from randomized controlled trials in routine clinical practice settings remain limited.\
The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of HBPM as an adjunct to standard care in improving blood pressure control in patients with essential hypertension.\

\fs28 \cf0 Study Design\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study conducted at a tertiary care outpatient clinic over a period of 6 months. The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and all participants provided written informed consent.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Participants\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 A total of 160 adults aged 30\'9675 years with a diagnosis of essential hypertension were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included office systolic blood pressure \uc0\u8805 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure \u8805 90 mmHg, or current use of antihypertensive medication.

\fs28 \cf0 Participant Characteristics\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Of the 160 enrolled participants, 152 completed the study (HBPM group: n = 76; control group: n = 76). Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, baseline blood pressure, body mass index, and number of antihypertensive medications, were comparable between groups.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Primary Outcomes\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 At 6 months, the HBPM group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in blood pressure compared to the control group. Mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 14.6 \'b1 9.3 mmHg in the HBPM group versus 7.2 \'b1 8.1 mmHg in the control group (p < 0.001). Mean diastolic blood pressure decreased by 8.9 \'b1 6.2 mmHg versus 4.1 \'b1 5.4 mmHg, respectively (p < 0.001).\
A higher proportion of participants in the HBPM group achieved target blood pressure (<130/80 mmHg) compared to the control group (62% vs. 38%, p = 0.002).\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Secondary Outcomes\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Medication adherence scores improved significantly in the HBPM group, with mean MMAS-8 scores increasing from 6.1 to 7.4, compared to a smaller increase in the control group (6.2 to 6.6; p < 0.01). Patient satisfaction scores were also significantly higher in the intervention group.\
The HBPM group experienced more frequent but appropriate antihypertensive medication adjustments, suggesting improved clinical decision-making based on more comprehensive blood pressure data.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Adverse Events\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 No serious adverse events were reported. Minor issues included initial anxiety related to self-measurement in a small number of participants, which resolved after further education.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Discussion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This randomized controlled study demonstrates that HBPM significantly improves blood pressure control in patients with essential hypertension when combined with standard care. The magnitude of blood pressure reduction observed in the HBPM group is clinically meaningful and associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events.\
Several mechanisms may explain these findings. HBPM likely enhances patient awareness and engagement, leading to improved medication adherence and lifestyle modifications. Additionally, more frequent blood pressure data may facilitate timely and accurate treatment adjustments by clinicians.\
The improved adherence observed in this study aligns with previous research suggesting that patient involvement in self-monitoring fosters a sense of ownership over disease management. Increased patient satisfaction further supports the acceptability of HBPM in routine care.\
Limitations of this study include its single-center design and relatively short follow-up period. Future studies should assess long-term outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and integration of digital health platforms for remote data transmission.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Home blood pressure monitoring, when combined with standard care, significantly improves blood pressure control, medication adherence, and patient satisfaction in patients with essential hypertension. These findings support the routine incorporation of HBPM into hypertension management strategies to improve clinical outcomes.\
