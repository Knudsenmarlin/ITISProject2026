\f1\b\fs48 \cf0 \strokec2 Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation on Immune Function in Adults with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\fs36 \cf0 Abstract\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Background:
\f0\b0  Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by persistent fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and immune dysregulation. Vitamin D plays a role in immune modulation, but its therapeutic potential in CFS remains poorly understood.\

\f1\b Objective:
\f0\b0  To investigate the effects of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on immune function, fatigue severity, and quality of life in adults with CFS.\

\f1\b Methods:
\f0\b0  In this 16-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 100 adults with CFS and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels <30 ng/mL were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D3 (10,000 IU daily, n = 50) or placebo (n = 50). Primary outcomes included changes in fatigue severity (measured using the Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS) and immune markers (interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-\uc0\u945 ], and natural killer [NK] cell activity). Secondary outcomes included quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire), sleep quality, and safety parameters.\

\f1\b Results:
\f0\b0  At 16 weeks, the vitamin D group demonstrated significant improvement in FSS scores (mean change \uc0\u8722 1.8 \'b1 0.7) compared to placebo (\u8722 0.4 \'b1 0.5, p < 0.001). NK cell activity increased by 25% in the vitamin D group, while remaining unchanged in controls (p < 0.01). IL-6 and TNF-\u945  levels decreased significantly in the vitamin D group (\u8722 15.2% and \u8722 12.7%, respectively, p < 0.05), with no significant change in the placebo group. Improvements in physical and mental components of the SF-36 were also observed in the vitamin D group. No serious adverse events were reported.\

\f1\b Conclusions:
\f0\b0  High-dose vitamin D supplementation enhances immune function and reduces fatigue in adults with CFS. These findings suggest vitamin D may be a safe adjunct therapy for symptom management in CFS, warranting larger, long-term studies.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Introduction\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is a complex disorder characterized by profound fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, and immune dysregulation. Its etiology is multifactorial, involving interactions between the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. Despite significant morbidity, there is no universally effective therapy, highlighting the need for safe interventions targeting underlying mechanisms.\
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble secosteroid essential for calcium homeostasis and bone health. Emerging evidence indicates that vitamin D also plays a critical role in innate and adaptive immunity, modulating cytokine production, T cell differentiation, and NK cell activity. Deficiency in vitamin D has been associated with increased susceptibility to infections, autoimmune disorders, and fatigue-related syndromes.\
Previous observational studies suggest that individuals with CFS often exhibit low serum 25(OH)D levels. Experimental studies indicate that vitamin D can modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\uc0\u945 ), which are implicated in CFS pathophysiology. However, randomized controlled trials examining vitamin D supplementation in CFS are limited.\
This study aimed to evaluate the effects of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on immune function, fatigue severity, and quality of life in adults with CFS and vitamin D insufficiency. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation would improve immune markers and reduce fatigue symptoms compared to placebo.\

\fs28 \cf0 Study Design and Participants\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This study was a single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted over 16 weeks. Participants were recruited from a tertiary fatigue clinic and community advertisements. Inclusion criteria were: age 18\'9665 years, diagnosis of CFS according to the 1994 CDC criteria, serum 25(OH)D <30 ng/mL, and stable medication regimen for at least 3 months. Exclusion criteria included hypercalcemia, renal or hepatic insufficiency, pregnancy or lactation, current use of high-dose vitamin D (>2,000 IU/day), or history of kidney stones.\
Eligible participants provided written informed consent and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to vitamin D or placebo using a computer-generated sequence, stratified by sex and baseline FSS score.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Intervention\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 The intervention group received oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) at a dose of 10,000 IU daily for 16 weeks. The placebo group received identical capsules containing inert excipients. Participants were instructed to maintain their usual diet and physical activity levels throughout the study. Compliance was monitored through capsule counts and serum 25(OH)D levels.\

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Sample size calculations indicated that 45 participants per group would provide 80% power to detect a 1-point difference in FSS scores (\uc0\u945  = 0.05). To account for potential dropouts, 50 participants were recruited per group.\
Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Continuous variables were expressed as mean \'b1 standard deviation. Between-group differences were assessed using repeated-measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni correction. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Discussion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that high-dose vitamin D supplementation significantly improves fatigue severity, immune function, and quality of life in adults with CFS and vitamin D insufficiency. The reduction in FSS scores (\uc0\u8722 1.8 points) is clinically meaningful, suggesting substantial symptom relief. Enhancements in NK cell activity and reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u945 ) support a role for vitamin D in modulating immune dysregulation, a key component of CFS pathophysiology.\
Improvements in quality of life and sleep quality further suggest that vitamin D supplementation has systemic benefits beyond immune modulation. The absence of serious adverse events indicates that high-dose vitamin D is generally safe when monitored appropriately.\
The mechanisms underlying these effects may involve vitamin D\'96mediated regulation of cytokine networks, promotion of regulatory T cell activity, and modulation of autonomic nervous system function. By reducing chronic low-grade inflammation, vitamin D may alleviate both physical and cognitive fatigue in CFS.\
Limitations of this study include the relatively short duration, single-center design, and lack of long-term follow-up. The generalizability of findings to patients with normal vitamin D levels or other fatigue-related disorders is unclear. Future studies should explore the durability of benefits, optimal dosing regimens, and combination strategies with exercise or cognitive-behavioral interventions.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Conclusion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 High-dose vitamin D supplementation for 16 weeks significantly improves fatigue, immune function, and quality of life in adults with CFS and vitamin D insufficiency. These findings support the potential of vitamin D as a safe and effective adjunct therapy for CFS. Long-term, multi-center trials are warranted to confirm these results and determine optimal treatment strategies.\
