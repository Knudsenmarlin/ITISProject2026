\f1\b\fs48 \cf0 \strokec2 The Effect of Intermittent Fasting on Glycemic Control in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\fs36 \cf0 Abstract\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Background:
\f0\b0  Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained attention as a potential strategy for improving metabolic health. Its effects on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remain unclear.\

\f1\b Objective:
\f0\b0  To evaluate the impact of a 12-week intermittent fasting regimen on fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, body weight, and lipid profile in adults with T2D.\

\f1\b Methods:
\f0\b0  In this randomized controlled trial, 120 adults with T2D were assigned to either an intermittent fasting group (IF, n = 60) or a control group receiving standard dietary advice (CON, n = 60). IF participants adhered to a 16:8 fasting protocol (16 hours fasting, 8 hours eating) daily for 12 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and lipid profile were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA and intention-to-treat principles.\

\f1\b Results:
\f0\b0  After 12 weeks, the IF group showed a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose (mean change: \uc0\u8722 18.6 mg/dL, p < 0.001) and HbA1c (mean change: \u8722 0.8%, p < 0.001) compared to the control group (\u8722 4.2 mg/dL and \u8722 0.2%, respectively). The IF group also experienced a mean weight loss of 4.3 kg and reduction in waist circumference of 3.5 cm, both significantly greater than the control group (p < 0.01). Improvements in total cholesterol and triglycerides were observed in the IF group, although HDL and LDL changes were not statistically significant.\

\f1\b Conclusions:
\f0\b0  A 12-week intermittent fasting regimen improves glycemic control and induces modest weight loss in adults with T2D. IF may be a practical adjunct to standard dietary management for T2D, but long-term effects and safety require further study.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Introduction\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation. Its prevalence has increased globally, presenting significant public health challenges due to associated complications such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Lifestyle interventions, particularly diet and physical activity, remain cornerstone strategies for glycemic management.\
Intermittent fasting (IF) has emerged as a promising dietary approach, involving alternating periods of energy restriction and ad libitum feeding. Common patterns include alternate-day fasting, 5:2 fasting, and time-restricted feeding, where individuals fast for a set number of hours each day. Evidence from animal studies and small human trials suggests that IF can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce body weight, and favorably modify lipid profiles. However, research specifically targeting adults with T2D is limited, and existing studies show heterogeneous results.\
This study aims to investigate the effects of a 12-week time-restricted intermittent fasting regimen on glycemic control, body composition, and lipid profile in adults with T2D. We hypothesized that IF would significantly improve fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels compared to standard dietary advice.\

\fs28 \cf0 Study Design and Participants\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This single-center, randomized controlled trial was conducted over 12 weeks. Participants were recruited from a community diabetes clinic and screened for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were: age 30\'9665 years, diagnosed with T2D for at least 1 year, BMI 25\'9640 kg/m\'b2, and stable antidiabetic medication use for \uc0\u8805 3 months. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, type 1 diabetes, history of eating disorders, chronic kidney or liver disease, or recent cardiovascular events.\
Eligible participants provided written informed consent and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the IF or control group using a computer-generated sequence. Randomization was stratified by sex and baseline HbA1c to ensure balance.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Intervention\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Participants in the IF group followed a 16:8 time-restricted fasting protocol: daily fasting for 16 consecutive hours and consuming all meals within an 8-hour window, typically between 10:00 AM and 6:00 PM. Water, black coffee, and unsweetened tea were allowed during fasting periods. Participants received dietary counseling to maintain habitual caloric intake and avoid compensatory overeating.\
The control group received standard dietary advice according to national guidelines for T2D management, emphasizing balanced macronutrient intake, portion control, and regular meal timing.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Outcome Measures\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Primary outcomes were changes in fasting blood glucose and HbA1c from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides).\
Measurements were performed at baseline and at 12 weeks by trained personnel blinded to group allocation. Fasting blood samples were analyzed using standardized enzymatic methods. Weight and height were measured using calibrated scales and stadiometers, and BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint between the lowest rib and iliac crest.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Adherence and Safety\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Participants in the IF group kept daily fasting logs, and adherence was defined as \uc0\u8805 80% of fasting days completed. Adverse events, including hypoglycemia, dizziness, or gastrointestinal discomfort, were recorded throughout the study.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Statistical Analysis\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Sample size calculations estimated that 50 participants per group would provide 80% power to detect a 0.5% difference in HbA1c between groups, assuming a standard deviation of 0.8%, at a two-sided \uc0\u945  of 0.05. To account for potential dropouts, 60 participants per group were recruited.\
Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were expressed as mean \'b1 standard deviation. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to assess changes over time and between-group differences. Post hoc analyses were conducted using Bonferroni correction. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square tests. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.\

\fs28 \cf0 Participant Flow and Baseline Characteristics\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Of 160 individuals screened, 120 met inclusion criteria and were randomized (IF: n = 60; CON: n = 60). Four participants in the IF group and five in the control group discontinued before study completion due to personal reasons or loss to follow-up. The final analysis included all participants under intention-to-treat principles.\
Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups (Table 1). Mean age was 52.3 \'b1 8.1 years, 55% were female, mean BMI was 32.1 \'b1 3.8 kg/m\'b2, mean fasting blood glucose was 154.2 \'b1 22.7 mg/dL, and mean HbA1c was 7.9 \'b1 0.8%.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 \strokec2 Secondary Outcomes\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 The IF group lost an average of 4.3 \'b1 2.1 kg compared to 0.9 \'b1 1.8 kg in the control group (p < 0.01). Waist circumference decreased by 3.5 \'b1 1.7 cm in IF participants versus 0.8 \'b1 1.5 cm in controls (p < 0.01). BMI reduction was more pronounced in the IF group (\uc0\u8722 1.5 \'b1 0.7 kg/m\'b2) compared to controls (\u8722 0.3 \'b1 0.6 kg/m\'b2, p < 0.01).\
Total cholesterol decreased modestly in the IF group (\uc0\u8722 12.4 \'b1 15.6 mg/dL) versus controls (\u8722 3.1 \'b1 14.2 mg/dL, p = 0.02). Triglycerides fell by 18.7 \'b1 22.1 mg/dL in IF participants compared to 5.2 \'b1 19.3 mg/dL in controls (p = 0.01). Changes in HDL and LDL cholesterol were not statistically significant between groups.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Discussion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that a 12-week intermittent fasting regimen significantly improves glycemic control and induces modest weight loss in adults with T2D. The observed reduction in fasting blood glucose (\uc0\u8722 18.6 mg/dL) and HbA1c (\u8722 0.8%) is clinically meaningful, comparable to the effect of adding a single oral antidiabetic agent.\
The improvements in body weight and waist circumference suggest that time-restricted fasting may reduce central adiposity, a key contributor to insulin resistance. Modest reductions in total cholesterol and triglycerides further indicate potential cardiovascular benefits. The lack of significant changes in HDL and LDL cholesterol may reflect the short duration of the intervention.\
High adherence and minimal adverse events suggest that time-restricted fasting is a feasible and safe dietary strategy for adults with T2D. However, careful monitoring is required, particularly for individuals on insulin or sulfonylureas, due to risk of hypoglycemia.\
Mechanistically, IF may improve glycemic control by enhancing insulin sensitivity, promoting beta-cell function, and modulating circadian rhythms related to metabolism. Fasting periods may also reduce postprandial glucose excursions and lower systemic inflammation.\
Limitations of this study include its relatively short duration, single-center design, and reliance on self-reported adherence. Long-term effects on glycemic control, cardiovascular outcomes, and quality of life remain to be established. Future studies should explore different fasting protocols, effects in patients on various antidiabetic medications, and integration with lifestyle interventions such as exercise.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 A 12-week intermittent fasting regimen is effective in improving glycemic control, reducing body weight, and favorably modifying lipid profile in adults with T2D. Time-restricted fasting appears safe, feasible, and may serve as a practical adjunct to standard dietary management. Long-term studies are warranted to determine sustained benefits and broader applicability in diverse populations.\
