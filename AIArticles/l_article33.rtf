\f1\b\fs48 \cf0 \strokec2 Effect of Probiotic Supplementation on Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Inflammatory Markers in Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Trial\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa298\partightenfactor0

\fs36 \cf0 Abstract\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Background:
\f0\b0  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. Low-grade inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis have been implicated in its pathophysiology. Probiotics have emerged as a potential therapeutic option, but evidence for their efficacy in IBS is inconsistent.\

\f1\b Objective:
\f0\b0  To investigate the effects of a multi-strain probiotic supplementation on gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of life, and systemic inflammatory markers in patients with IBS.\

\f1\b Methods:
\f0\b0  In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 120 adults aged 18\'9665 years with IBS diagnosed according to Rome IV criteria were randomly assigned to either a probiotic group (n = 60) or placebo group (n = 60) for 12 weeks. The probiotic contained Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium longum, and Lactobacillus plantarum (10^10 CFU/day). Primary outcomes were changes in IBS symptom severity score (IBS-SSS) and quality of life (IBS-QOL). Secondary outcomes included serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and fecal calprotectin.\

\f1\b Results:
\f0\b0  After 12 weeks, the probiotic group exhibited a significant reduction in IBS-SSS (mean change \uc0\u8722 75.4 \'b1 32.8) compared to placebo (\u8722 22.1 \'b1 29.5, p < 0.001). IBS-QOL scores improved by 15.7 \'b1 7.2 points in the probiotic group versus 4.2 \'b1 6.8 in controls (p < 0.001). CRP and IL-6 levels decreased significantly in the probiotic group (\u8722 1.2 \'b1 0.6 mg/L and \u8722 2.5 \'b1 1.1 pg/mL, respectively), with no significant changes in placebo. Fecal calprotectin levels declined modestly in the probiotic group but remained unchanged in controls. No serious adverse events were reported.\

\f1\b Conclusions:
\f0\b0  Twelve-week multi-strain probiotic supplementation significantly improves gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of life, and reduces systemic inflammation in IBS patients. Probiotics may offer a safe and effective adjunct therapy for IBS management.\

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Introduction\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder affecting approximately 10\'9615% of the adult population worldwide. It is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and alterations in bowel habits, leading to substantial impairment in quality of life. The pathophysiology of IBS is multifactorial, involving altered gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, low-grade inflammation, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, and psychosocial stress.\
Recent research has highlighted the role of gut microbiota in IBS. Altered microbial composition can promote inflammation, increase intestinal permeability, and affect neuromodulation, contributing to symptom manifestation. Probiotics, live microorganisms that confer health benefits, have been proposed as a therapeutic intervention aimed at restoring microbiota balance and reducing inflammation.\
Clinical trials of probiotics in IBS have shown mixed results, likely due to variations in probiotic strains, doses, and study populations. Systematic evaluation of multi-strain probiotics targeting both symptom improvement and inflammatory markers is needed to clarify their efficacy.\
The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 12-week multi-strain probiotic supplementation on IBS symptom severity and quality of life. Secondary aims included assessment of systemic inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6) and fecal calprotectin as an indicator of intestinal inflammation. We hypothesized that probiotic supplementation would significantly reduce IBS symptoms, improve quality of life, and decrease inflammation compared to placebo.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf0 Intervention\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 The probiotic group received capsules containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium longum, and Lactobacillus plantarum (total 10^10 CFU/day). The placebo group received identical capsules containing inert excipients. Participants were instructed to take one capsule daily and maintain their usual diet and lifestyle.

\f1\b\fs36 \cf0 \strokec2 Discussion\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 This study demonstrates that 12-week multi-strain probiotic supplementation significantly improves gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in patients with IBS. The observed reduction in IBS-SSS (\uc0\u8722 75 points) exceeds the minimal clinically important difference, indicating a meaningful improvement in symptom burden.\
The improvement in IBS-QOL suggests that symptom relief translated into enhanced daily functioning and psychosocial well-being. Reduction in systemic inflammatory markers (CRP and IL-6) and modest decreases in fecal calprotectin suggest that probiotics may attenuate low-grade inflammation, consistent with mechanistic hypotheses linking gut microbiota to IBS pathophysiology.\
These findings support the therapeutic potential of multi-strain probiotics in IBS management. Strain selection, dosage, and treatment duration are critical determinants of efficacy. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium longum, and Lactobacillus plantarum may synergistically modulate gut microbiota, enhance epithelial barrier function, and reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines.\

\f1\b \cf0 Limitations:
\f0\b0  The study was single-center and limited to 12 weeks. Long-term efficacy, relapse rates, and effects in diverse populations remain unknown. Microbiota composition was not analyzed, limiting mechanistic insight.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf0 Twelve-week multi-strain probiotic supplementation significantly improves gastrointestinal symptoms, quality of life, and reduces systemic inflammation in patients with IBS. Probiotics are safe, well tolerated, and may serve as a non-pharmacological adjunct therapy for IBS management. Future multi-center trials with longer follow-up and microbiome analyses are warranted.\
