Title: Donanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease: 36-Month Clinical and Biomarker Outcomes
Background: While anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated slowing of clinical decline in early Alzheimer's disease over 18-month trials, data on long-term effects and the durability of amyloid plaque removal are essential.
Methods: This open-label extension study (TRAILBLAZER-EXT) enrolled 257 participants from the phase II TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial of donanemab, an antibody targeting deposited amyloid-beta. All eligible participants received monthly intravenous donanemab. Co-primary outcomes were the change from the original trial baseline in the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) and in brain amyloid plaque burden measured by positron emission tomography at 36 months. Exploratory biomarkers included tau PET and plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).
Results: At the 36-month timepoint, participants who received continuous donanemab treatment showed a mean iADRS decline of 8.2 points from baseline, compared to a 17.5-point decline in participants whose treatment was delayed (the placebo crossover group) (P<0.001). Amyloid PET confirmed that plaque levels remained very low (Centiloid value <20) in 92% of continuously treated participants. Reductions in tau PET signal and plasma GFAP, markers of downstream neurodegeneration and astrocytic activation, were also sustained. The incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema (ARIA-E) during the extension phase was 6.5%.
Conclusion: Sustained donanemab treatment over 36 months resulted in a persistently slower rate of clinical decline and maintained clearance of amyloid plaques in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. These long-term data support the disease-modifying potential of amyloid removal and the importance of continued treatment.
