Title: Two-Year Neurodevelopmental Outcomes after Early High-Dose Erythropoietin in Very Preterm Infants
Background: High-dose erythropoietin has shown neuroprotective potential in preclinical models of neonatal brain injury. The phase III PENUT trial found no reduction in severe neurodevelopmental impairment at 22–26 months in infants born at 24–28 weeks’ gestation.
Methods: This prespecified follow-up study of the PENUT trial cohort reports neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years corrected age. Surviving children were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. The primary outcome was the composite of death or neurodevelopmental impairment, defined as a cognitive or motor composite score <70, severe cerebral palsy, blindness, or deafness.
Results: Of the 936 infants enrolled in the primary trial, 741 (79%) were assessed at 2 years. The composite outcome of death or neurodevelopmental impairment occurred in 32% of the erythropoietin group and 34% of the placebo group (relative risk 0.95; 95% CI 0.78–1.15; P=0.58). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in any Bayley-III subscale scores (cognitive, motor, language), rates of cerebral palsy, or rates of severe visual or hearing impairment.
Conclusion: Administration of high-dose erythropoietin to very preterm infants did not improve neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years corrected age. These definitive long-term results do not support the use of erythropoietin for neuroprotection in this population.
