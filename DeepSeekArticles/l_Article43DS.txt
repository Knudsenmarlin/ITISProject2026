Title: Safety of Early Direct Oral Anticoagulant Initiation after Acute Ischemic Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
Background: Initiating anticoagulation after an acute ischemic stroke related to atrial fibrillation involves balancing the risk of hemorrhagic transformation against the risk of recurrent embolism. The optimal timing for direct oral anticoagulant initiation is uncertain.
Methods: The START-AF trial randomized 500 patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS ≤15) and atrial fibrillation to early DOAC initiation (between 48 hours and 7 days post-stroke) or delayed initiation (between day 7 and 14). All patients received bridging aspirin. The primary safety outcome was symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation or major extracranial bleeding within 30 days. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke.
Results: Symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation occurred in 1.6% of the early group and 1.2% of the delayed group (risk difference 0.4%; 95% CI −1.5 to 2.3; P=0.68). Recurrent ischemic stroke within 30 days occurred in 2.0% of the early group and 4.8% of the delayed group (hazard ratio 0.41; 95% CI 0.17–0.99; P=0.048). Rates of major extracranial bleeding were low and similar between groups.
Conclusion: Early initiation of a direct oral anticoagulant (within 48 hours to 7 days) after an acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation was not associated with an increased risk of symptomatic hemorrhage and significantly reduced the risk of early recurrent ischemic stroke. These findings support a shift toward earlier, safer anticoagulation in this population.
