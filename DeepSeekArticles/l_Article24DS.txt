Title: Adjuvant Whole-Brain Radiotherapy vs. Observation after Resection of a Single Brain Metastasis
Background: The role of adjuvant whole-brain radiotherapy following complete surgical resection of a solitary brain metastasis is highly controversial, given the trade-off between intracranial control and neurocognitive toxicity.
Methods: We randomized 200 patients who had undergone complete resection of a single brain metastasis to receive adjuvant whole-brain radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) or to observation with close MRI surveillance (stereotactic radiosurgery permitted for salvage). The primary endpoint was intracranial progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, neurocognitive function assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), and quality of life.
Results: Adjuvant WBRT significantly prolonged intracranial progression-free survival (median 15 months vs. 8 months; hazard ratio 0.52; P<0.001) and reduced the rate of distant brain failure at 1 year (25% vs. 60%). However, it was associated with significant decline in HVLT-R delayed recall scores at 4 months (P=0.003) and worse patient-reported cognitive function. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two groups.
Conclusion: While adjuvant whole-brain radiotherapy after resection of a single brain metastasis significantly improved intracranial control, it came at the cost of measurable neurocognitive decline. In an era of effective salvage stereotactic radiosurgery, a strategy of close observation and MRI surveillance represents a preferable approach for most patients, prioritizing quality of life and cognitive function.
