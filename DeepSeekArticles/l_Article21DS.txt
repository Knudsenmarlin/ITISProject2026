Title: Intratumoral Oncolytic Virus Combined with Pembrolizumab for Anti-PD-1 Refractory Melanoma
Background: Resistance to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade remains a major challenge in advanced melanoma. Intratumoral injection of oncolytic viruses can induce immunogenic cell death and may help overcome this resistance by remodeling the tumor microenvironment.
Methods: We conducted a phase I/II, open-label study in patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma that had progressed on prior anti-PD-1 therapy. Participants received weekly intratumoral injections of the coxsackievirus A21-based oncolytic virus V937 for up to 18 doses, combined with standard intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. The phase I primary endpoint was safety. The phase II primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) assessed by RECIST v1.1 in non-injected (distant) lesions.
Results: Forty-five patients were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and the most common treatment-related adverse events were transient flu-like symptoms (64%). The confirmed objective response rate in non-injected lesions was 24% (11/45), including two complete responses. The disease control rate was 58%. Responders exhibited increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration and upregulated interferon-gamma gene expression signatures in post-treatment tumor biopsies, indicating a shift toward an inflamed tumor microenvironment.
Conclusion: The combination of intratumoral V937 and systemic pembrolizumab demonstrated a manageable safety profile and clinically meaningful antitumor activity in patients with PD-1 refractory melanoma. These results support the hypothesis that localized viral therapy can enhance systemic immune responses and warrant further investigation of this combination strategy.
