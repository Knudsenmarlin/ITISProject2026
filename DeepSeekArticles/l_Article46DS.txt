Title: Consolidation Nivolumab after Chemoradiation in Locally Advanced NSCLC with High Tumor Mutational Burden
Background: Consolidation immunotherapy improves outcomes in stage III NSCLC, but biomarkers to identify patients most likely to benefit are needed. Tumor mutational burden is a potential predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy.
Methods: This single-arm, phase II study enrolled patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC and high TMB (≥10 mutations per megabase by FoundationOne CDx) who had completed concurrent chemoradiation. Participants received consolidation nivolumab for up to one year. The primary endpoint was 18-month progression-free survival. Historical outcomes from the PACIFIC trial (all-comers, irrespective of TMB) were used for comparison.
Results: Among 45 enrolled patients, the 18-month progression-free survival rate was 75% (95% CI 64–86%), compared to 44.2% in the PACIFIC placebo arm and 55.7% in the durvalumab arm. Median progression-free survival was 30.1 months. The 18-month overall survival rate was 88%. The incidence of pneumonitis of any grade was 22% (grade 3+ in 7%), similar to rates reported in PACIFIC.
Conclusion: Consolidation nivolumab in patients with stage III NSCLC and high tumor mutational burden demonstrated exceptional progression-free survival, suggesting TMB may be a powerful predictive biomarker for exceptional benefit from immunotherapy consolidation. Prospective validation of TMB as a stratification tool in this setting is warranted.
