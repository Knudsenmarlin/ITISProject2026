Title: Gut Microbiome as a Predictor of Response to Ustekinumab in Crohn's Disease
Background: Ustekinumab is effective for Crohn’s disease, but a significant proportion of patients do not respond. Baseline host and microbial factors that predict response could guide personalized therapeutic selection.
Methods: In this multicenter, prospective study, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on stool samples from 120 patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease before initiation of ustekinumab. The primary clinical outcome was corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 24, defined as a Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≤4. Machine learning models were used to identify microbial species and functional pathways associated with treatment response.
Results: At week 24, 58% of patients (70/120) achieved remission. A model based on the relative abundance of 15 baseline microbial species predicted response with an area under the curve of 0.81. Responders were enriched in species such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia inulinivorans, and in microbial pathways for short-chain fatty acid production. Non-responders had higher abundances of pro-inflammatory species like Ruminococcus gnavus. These microbial features were more predictive than clinical characteristics alone.
Conclusion: The composition and functional potential of the baseline gut microbiome were strongly associated with ustekinumab response in Crohn’s disease. If validated, a microbiome-based predictive signature could become a valuable tool for optimizing biologic therapy selection, moving towards a more precise, patient-centered approach to inflammatory bowel disease management.
