Title: Robotic vs. Laparoscopic Hepatectomy for Colorectal Liver Metastases
Background: Robotic surgery offers potential technical advantages over conventional laparoscopy for complex procedures like liver resection, but its comparative benefits in oncologic surgery require robust evaluation.
Methods: Using an international, multi-institutional hepatobiliary registry, we performed a propensity-score matched analysis. We identified 450 patients who underwent robotic hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases and matched them 1:1 to patients who underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy based on key prognostic variables: number and size of metastases, tumor location, and future liver remnant volume. Primary outcomes were the rate of "textbook outcome" (a composite of R0 resection, no severe complications, no 90-day readmission, and length of stay ≤ the 75th percentile) and overall survival.
Results: The robotic approach was associated with a higher rate of achieving a textbook outcome (68% vs. 58%; P=0.01), driven by significantly higher R0 resection margins (91% vs. 84%; P=0.01) and a shorter median length of stay (4 vs. 5 days; P=0.02). Rates of severe complications were comparable. After a median follow-up of 36 months, 3-year overall survival was 82% for robotic and 78% for laparoscopic resection (hazard ratio 0.81; 95% CI 0.62-1.06; P=0.12). The rate of conversion to open surgery was markedly lower in the robotic group (2% vs. 8%; P<0.001).
Conclusion: Robotic liver resection for colorectal metastases was associated with a higher likelihood of achieving an optimal postoperative outcome compared to laparoscopy, with particular benefits in resection margin status and conversion rates. These data support the robotic platform as a valuable tool in minimally invasive liver surgery.
