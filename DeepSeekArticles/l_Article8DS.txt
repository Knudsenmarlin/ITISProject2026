Title: Safety and Immunogenicity of High-Dose vs. Standard-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine in Older Adults
Background: Immunosenescence, the age-related decline in immune function, leads to suboptimal responses to standard influenza vaccines in adults aged 65 years and older. High-dose formulations are designed to overcome this limitation.
Methods: In this phase IV, randomized, observer-blinded study, 1,200 community-dwelling participants aged 65 years or older were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular injection of either a high-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (containing 60 μg of hemagglutinin antigen per strain) or a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine (containing 15 μg per strain). Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers were measured at baseline and 28 days post-vaccination against the four vaccine strains. Reactogenicity and adverse events were actively monitored for 7 days following vaccination.
Results: The high-dose vaccine met all pre-specified statistical criteria for superiority over the standard-dose vaccine. The geometric mean titer ratios (high-dose divided by standard-dose) at day 28 were 1.8 for A/H1N1, 2.1 for A/H3N2, 1.6 for B/Victoria, and 1.7 for B/Yamagata lineages (all P<0.001). Seroconversion rates were also significantly higher for all four strains in the high-dose group. Injection-site reactions, such as pain and erythema, were more frequently reported in the high-dose group, but were predominantly mild and transient. No new safety concerns were identified.
Conclusion: In adults 65 years of age and older, the high-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine elicited a significantly stronger antibody response against all vaccine strains compared to the standard-dose formulation, with a clinically acceptable safety profile. These immunogenicity data support its use to enhance protection in this vulnerable population.
