Title: Empagliflozin for Prevention of Atrial Fibrillation in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction: A Prespecified Analysis
Background: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), but their effect on the development of atrial fibrillation, a common and consequential comorbidity, is unknown.
Methods: This was a prespecified, investigator-initiated analysis of the EMPEROR-Preserved trial database, which randomized 5,988 patients with HFpEF to empagliflozin or placebo. The primary outcome for this analysis was the time to first adjudicated event of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, identified through adverse event reporting, 12-lead electrocardiograms, or Holter monitoring. Secondary outcomes included AF/AFL-related hospitalizations and ischemic stroke. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards models.
Results: Over a median follow-up of 26.2 months, incident AF/AFL occurred in 4.3% of patients in the empagliflozin group and 5.8% in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.91; P=0.005). The reduction in risk was consistent for both new-onset and recurrent AF/AFL. Empagliflozin treatment was also associated with a significant reduction in hospitalizations related to atrial fibrillation (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.49-0.88). The treatment effect on AF/AFL was independent of baseline history of atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection fraction, or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level.
Conclusion: Empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of incident and recurrent atrial fibrillation and flutter in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This represents a novel and important pleiotropic benefit of SGLT2 inhibition that extends beyond heart failure outcomes and may contribute to the improved clinical trajectory observed with this drug class.
