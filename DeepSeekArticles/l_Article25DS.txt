Title: A Pediatric Asthma Care Bundle to Reduce Racial Disparities in ED Revisits
Background: Significant racial disparities exist in pediatric asthma outcomes, with Black children experiencing higher rates of emergency department revisits. Standardized care bundles have the potential to improve equity by ensuring all patients receive evidence-based interventions.
Methods: We implemented a multi-component asthma care bundle in a large, urban pediatric emergency department. The bundle included: (1) standardized severity assessment and therapy protocol, (2) a mandatory, culturally tailored asthma education video, (3) a bundled discharge prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid and oral corticosteroid, and (4) a scheduled follow-up appointment with primary care or asthma specialty within 7 days. Using an interrupted time series design, we analyzed 90-day ED revisit rates over 36 months, stratifying outcomes by patient race (Black vs. white).
Results: Following bundle implementation, the overall 90-day ED revisit rate decreased from 18% to 12% (P<0.001). The disparity gap narrowed substantially: revisit rates for Black children fell from 22% to 13% (absolute reduction 9 percentage points), while rates for white children fell from 14% to 11% (absolute reduction 3 percentage points). Bundle component completion, particularly the guaranteed follow-up appointment, was high and equitable across racial groups post-implementation.
Conclusion: A standardized, equity-focused asthma care bundle in the pediatric ED significantly reduced overall revisit rates and, critically, narrowed the racial disparity in this key outcome. System-level interventions that standardize best practices can be powerful tools for advancing health equity.
