Title: Bilateral vs. High-Dose Right Unilateral Electroconvulsive Therapy for Severe Treatment-Resistant Depression
Background: Bilateral electroconvulsive therapy is highly effective but associated with greater cognitive side effects than right unilateral electrode placement. The comparative efficacy of modern, high-dose right unilateral ECT remains debated.
Methods: In the BETA trial, 120 patients with severe, treatment-resistant depression were randomized to receive either bilateral ECT or high-dose right unilateral ECT (at 6 times the seizure threshold) thrice weekly. The primary outcome was remission rate (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-24 score ≤10) after 6 treatments. Secondary outcomes included speed of response and cognitive side effects assessed by the Autobiographical Memory Interview.
Results: Remission rates after 6 treatments were significantly higher with bilateral ECT (55%) than with right unilateral ECT (32%) (P=0.01). The median time to first response was shorter with bilateral placement (4 vs. 6 treatments; P=0.02). However, bilateral ECT was associated with significantly greater retrograde autobiographical memory impairment at the end of the treatment course (P=0.004).
Conclusion: Bilateral ECT led to faster and higher remission rates than high-dose right unilateral ECT in severe treatment-resistant depression but caused more significant memory side effects. This trade-off underscores the necessity for individualized treatment planning and shared decision-making based on priorities for speed/efficacy versus cognitive preservation.
