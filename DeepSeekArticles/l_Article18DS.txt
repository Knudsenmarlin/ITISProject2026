Title: Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty vs. Liraglutide for Class I-II Obesity: The MERIT Trial
Background: Endoscopic bariatric therapies and pharmacotherapy are both first-line interventions for moderate obesity, but direct comparative effectiveness data are lacking.
Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 160 adults with a body mass index of 30.0 to 39.9 kg/m² were assigned to undergo endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure that reduces gastric volume, or to receive daily subcutaneous liraglutide, titrated to the 3.0 mg dose. The primary endpoint was percent total body weight loss at 52 weeks. Secondary endpoints included changes in cardiometabolic parameters, patient-reported quality of life, and safety.
Results: At 52 weeks, the mean percent total body weight loss was 18.2% in the ESG group, compared to 7.5% in the liraglutide group, resulting in a mean between-group difference of 10.7 percentage points (P<0.0001). ESG also led to significantly greater improvements in hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, and alanine aminotransferase levels. Gastrointestinal side effects were frequent with liraglutide, while ESG was associated with a 3% rate of serious procedure-related adverse events (e.g., periprocedural pain, one case of delayed bleeding). Patient-reported outcomes for physical function and body image favored the ESG group.
Conclusion: Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in superior weight loss and metabolic improvement compared to high-dose liraglutide in patients with class I and II obesity. The choice between these interventions involves a trade-off between the greater efficacy and invasiveness of ESG and the non-invasive but less potent pharmacologic approach.
