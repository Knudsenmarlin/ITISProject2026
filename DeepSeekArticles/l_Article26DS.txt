Title: Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy with or without Atezolizumab for Operable Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
Background: The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has improved pathologic complete response rates in triple-negative breast cancer, but long-term survival data are essential to confirm clinical benefit.
Methods: In the phase III NEOPACT trial, 600 patients with previously untreated stage II or III triple-negative breast cancer were randomized to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel plus carboplatin, followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) with or without the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab. Atezolizumab was continued postoperatively as adjuvant therapy for up to one year. The dual primary endpoints were pathologic complete response (pCR, defined as ypT0/is ypN0) and event-free survival.
Results: The pCR rate was significantly higher with atezolizumab (62% vs. 48% with chemotherapy alone; P=0.001). With a median follow-up of 42 months, event-free survival was significantly longer in the atezolizumab arm (hazard ratio for event or death, 0.69; 95% CI 0.53–0.90; P=0.006). The 3-year event-free survival rate was 82% with atezolizumab versus 72% with chemotherapy alone. The benefit was most pronounced in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors and those who achieved a pCR. Immune-related adverse events were consistent with the known profile of atezolizumab.
Conclusion: Adding atezolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer significantly improved both pathologic complete response rates and long-term event-free survival, establishing a new standard of care for this aggressive disease subtype.
