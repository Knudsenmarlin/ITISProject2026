Title: Long-Term Follow-up of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy for Treatment-Resistant Depression
Background: Psilocybin therapy has shown promising, rapid antidepressant effects in clinical trials, but critical questions remain regarding the durability of response beyond the initial months following treatment.
Methods: This study reports the 12-month follow-up data from a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial. In the parent trial, 50 patients with moderate-to-severe treatment-resistant major depression received a single 25-mg dose of psilocybin administered in conjunction with structured psychological support. Waitlist control participants received the same intervention after an 8-week delay. The primary depression outcome was the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 8 weeks (primary endpoint), 6 months, and 12 months for the initial treatment group.
Results: For the 24 participants in the initial immediate-treatment group, the mean MADRS score decreased from 32.4 at baseline to 9.2 at the 8-week primary endpoint. This improvement was largely sustained at 12 months, with a mean score of 10.8, representing a mean change of -21.6 points from baseline (P<0.0001). At the 12-month follow-up, 71% of these participants met criteria for response (≥50% reduction in MADRS), and 58% met criteria for remission (MADRS ≤10). No participants required an additional psilocybin session during the follow-up period. No serious adverse events were reported after the acute dosing period.
Conclusion: A single dose of psilocybin, administered in a therapeutic context with psychological support, was associated with substantial and durable antidepressant effects that were maintained for at least one year in patients with treatment-resistant depression. These findings suggest the potential for a paradigm-shifting, long-acting intervention.
