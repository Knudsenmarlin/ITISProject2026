Title: Selpercatinib in RET Fusion-Positive Advanced Solid Tumors Beyond Lung and Thyroid Cancer
Background: RET gene fusions are oncogenic drivers in multiple solid tumor types, yet the efficacy of selective RET inhibition has primarily been established in non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer. The activity in other malignancies is undefined.
Methods: This was a multicenter, open-label, phase II basket study (LIBRETTO-001). We enrolled 45 patients with advanced RET fusion-positive solid tumors other than lung or thyroid, including pancreatic, colorectal, breast, salivary, and others. All participants received oral selpercatinib. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety.
Results: The overall objective response rate across all tumor types was 44% (20/45). Notable activity was observed in pancreatic cancer (2 of 5 patients with a partial response), colorectal cancer (3 of 8 with PR), and breast cancer (2 of 4 with PR). The median duration of response was 13.7 months. The safety profile was consistent with previous reports; common adverse events included dry mouth, hypertension, and elevated liver enzymes. Treatment was generally well-tolerated, with few discontinuations due to toxicity.
Conclusion: Selpercatinib demonstrated clinically meaningful antitumor activity in a variety of RET fusion-positive solid tumors beyond lung and thyroid cancer. These results support the use of comprehensive genomic profiling to identify RET fusions across tumor types and endorse a tumor-agnostic therapeutic strategy for this molecularly defined population.
