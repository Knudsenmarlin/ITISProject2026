Title: A Phase II Trial of Duvelisib in Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma
Background: Peripheral T-cell lymphoma carries a poor prognosis with current therapies, and novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. The PI3K-δ/γ isoforms are highly expressed in T-cell malignancies, making them a rational therapeutic target.
Methods: This was an open-label, single-arm, phase II study. We enrolled 45 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL (excluding ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma) who had received at least one prior systemic therapy. Participants received oral duvelisib 75 mg twice daily continuously in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was overall response rate assessed by an independent review committee using the Lugano 2014 classification. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety.
Results: The overall response rate was 38% (17 of 45 patients), with 7 complete responses. The median duration of response was 10.2 months, and the median progression-free survival was 5.8 months. Responses were observed across major PTCL subtypes, including PTCL-not otherwise specified and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. However, treatment was associated with significant toxicities: grade 3 or higher adverse events included transaminitis (27%), neutropenia (22%), diarrhea/colitis (18%), and pneumonitis (9%). These adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 31% of patients.
Conclusion: Duvelisib demonstrated clinically meaningful single-agent activity in relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, validating PI3K-δ/γ as a therapeutic target in this disease. However, the significant incidence of immune-mediated and hepatic toxicities necessitates careful patient selection, proactive monitoring, and consideration of combination strategies to improve tolerability.
