Title: Time-Restricted Eating for Weight Loss and Metabolic Health in Shift Workers
Background: Shift work disrupts circadian rhythms and is an independent risk factor for obesity and metabolic syndrome. Time-restricted eating, which consolidates caloric intake within a consistent daily window, may help mitigate these risks by realigning feeding-fasting cycles with endogenous rhythms.
Methods: The SHIFT-CLEAN trial randomized 150 shift workers (night or rotating shifts) with obesity to a 12-week intervention of time-restricted eating (TRE) or a control group. TRE participants were instructed to consume all calories within an 8-hour window aligned to their individual wake cycle (e.g., 12 PM–8 PM for a night-shift worker). Controls maintained their usual eating patterns. The primary outcome was change in body weight. Secondary outcomes included waist circumference, hemoglobin A1c, and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
Results: Participants in the TRE group lost significantly more weight than controls (-4.8 kg vs. -0.7 kg; P<0.001). They also achieved greater reductions in waist circumference (-4.2 cm vs. -0.8 cm; P=0.002) and HbA1c (-0.3% vs. -0.1%; P=0.04). Subjective sleep quality improved in the TRE group (PSQI change -2.1) but worsened slightly in controls (+0.3) (P=0.01). Adherence to the eating window was 78%, and no serious adverse events were reported.
Conclusion: Time-restricted eating aligned to shift schedules is an effective, feasible intervention for improving weight and metabolic health in shift workers, with the added benefit of improving perceived sleep quality. This simple dietary strategy addresses a key modifiable risk factor in a high-risk occupational group.
