Title: Telemedicine-Based Pharmacist Management of Uncontrolled Hypertension in Rural Primary Care
Background: Significant disparities in hypertension control exist between rural and urban populations, largely driven by limited access to specialty care and clinical pharmacists in rural settings.
Methods: We conducted a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial across 30 rural primary care practices, enrolling 1,512 adult patients with persistently uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic ≥90 mm Hg). Practices were randomized to implement a telemedicine intervention or to continue usual care. In intervention practices, patients received scheduled video consultations from a centralized team of clinical pharmacy specialists who provided guideline-based medication management (titration, combination therapy) and adherence counseling, supported by patient-reported home blood pressure monitoring. The primary outcome was the change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 months.
Results: At 12 months, the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was 20.8 mm Hg in the telemedicine intervention group, compared to 11.4 mm Hg in the usual care group, resulting in a between-group difference of -9.4 mm Hg (95% CI -12.1 to -6.7; P<0.001). Blood pressure control rates (<130/80 mm Hg) were 68% in the intervention arm versus 38% in the control arm (P<0.001). The intervention was associated with a greater number of antihypertensive medication intensifications and was highly rated by participants. No between-group differences in serious adverse events were observed.
Conclusion: A centralized, telemedicine-delivered clinical pharmacy service effectively and safely improved blood pressure control among patients in rural primary care practices. This scalable model addresses a critical access gap and has the potential to reduce geographic disparities in cardiovascular outcomes.
