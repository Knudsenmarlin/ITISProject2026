Title: Prophylactic Probiotics for Prevention of C. difficile Infection in Older Inpatients
Background: Clostridioides difficile infection is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and healthcare-associated infection, with older hospitalized adults at greatest risk. The role of probiotic prophylaxis in this specific, high-risk population remains uncertain.
Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients aged 65 years or older who were hospitalized and initiated on systemic antibiotic therapy. Participants were randomized to receive a high-potency, multi-strain probiotic capsule (containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species) or an identical placebo, twice daily during antibiotic treatment and for 7 days after its cessation. The primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed C. difficile infection within 30 days of antibiotic initiation.
Results: Among the 1,850 enrolled patients, CDI occurred in 1.2% (11/925) of the probiotic group and 2.8% (26/925) of the placebo group, yielding a relative risk of 0.43 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.87; P=0.02). The number needed to treat to prevent one case of CDI was 63. Probiotic administration was also associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea from any cause. There were no cases of probiotic-associated bacteremia or fungemia.
Conclusion: Prophylactic administration of a specific multi-strain probiotic significantly reduced the risk of C. difficile infection in older hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics. This safe and low-cost intervention represents a practical strategy for CDI prevention in a vulnerable population.
