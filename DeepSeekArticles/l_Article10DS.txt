Title: Diagnostic Accuracy of a Point-of-Care Ultrasound Protocol for Acute Heart Failure in the Emergency Department
Background: Rapid and accurate differentiation of acute heart failure from other causes of dyspnea in the emergency department is clinically challenging but essential for guiding appropriate therapy.
Methods: This was a prospective, multi-center diagnostic accuracy study conducted across three tertiary care emergency departments. We enrolled 1,050 consecutive adult patients presenting with acute dyspnea. Prior to final diagnostic adjudication, treating emergency physicians performed a standardized 5-view point-of-care ultrasound protocol. This protocol systematically assessed for sonographic B-lines (indicating pulmonary edema), left ventricular systolic function (visually estimated ejection fraction), and inferior vena cava diameter and collapsibility (estimating right atrial pressure). The primary outcome was the sensitivity and specificity of a pre-defined PoCUS diagnostic algorithm for the adjudicated final diagnosis of acute heart failure, using a composite reference standard of elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels and the final hospital discharge diagnosis.
Results: The point-of-care ultrasound algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 88-95) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI 86-92) for the diagnosis of acute heart failure. This performance was non-inferior to BNP testing alone. Furthermore, the use of PoCUS reduced the median time to a working diagnosis of heart failure by 48 minutes compared to standard diagnostic pathways (P<0.001). When PoCUS and BNP results were concordant, the specificity for heart failure increased to 96%.
Conclusion: A structured, protocolized point-of-care ultrasound examination is a rapid and accurate bedside tool for diagnosing acute heart failure in the emergency department. Its use can expedite time to diagnosis and appropriate treatment, and it provides complementary information to traditional biomarker testing.
