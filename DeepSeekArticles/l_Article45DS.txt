Title: Diagnostic Yield of Pan-Cancer Circulating Tumor DNA Testing in Cancer of Unknown Primary
Background: Identifying the tissue of origin in cancer of unknown primary is challenging but crucial for selecting targeted therapies. Plasma-based circulating tumor DNA testing may offer a minimally invasive solution.
Methods: We prospectively evaluated a 150-gene ctDNA panel with a machine-learning-based tissue-of-origin classifier in 200 patients with suspected cancer of unknown primary after standard diagnostic workup. The primary outcome was the rate at which the assay provided a tissue-of-origin prediction. Secondary outcomes included detection of actionable genomic alterations and concordance with subsequent biopsy or autopsy findings.
Results: The ctDNA assay provided a tissue-of-origin prediction in 55% of patients (110/200). In 70% of these, the prediction was made with high confidence (≥80%). In the 30 patients who later underwent definitive biopsy or autopsy, the ctDNA prediction was correct in 27 (90%). Actionable genomic alterations (e.g., in BRCA, HRR genes, or high tumor mutational burden) were found in 22% of all patients, independent of whether a tissue of origin was predicted.
Conclusion: Plasma-based ctDNA testing identified a putative tissue of origin in over half of patients with cancer of unknown primary and detected clinically actionable alterations in a substantial minority. This approach provides a valuable, complementary tool to guide site-directed therapy and targeted treatment in this difficult-to-manage patient population.
