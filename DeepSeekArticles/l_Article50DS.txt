Title: Association Between Physician Burnout and Diagnostic Errors in the Emergency Department
Background: Physician burnout is prevalent in emergency medicine and may impair cognitive function and clinical decision-making, but a direct link to patient safety outcomes like diagnostic errors has been difficult to establish.
Methods: We prospectively followed 150 attending emergency physicians over 12 months. Burnout was measured quarterly using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. All patient cases were screened for potential diagnostic errors using a validated trigger tool, with subsequent adjudication by an expert panel. The primary outcome was the adjusted odds of a physician being involved in a diagnostic error in a given month, based on their concurrent emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores.
Results: High emotional exhaustion and high depersonalization were independently associated with increased odds of diagnostic error. For each 1-point increase on the emotional exhaustion subscale (range 0–54), the monthly odds of an error increased by 8% (adjusted OR 1.08; 95% CI 1.03–1.13). Physicians in the highest tertile of depersonalization had 2.3 times the odds (95% CI 1.4–3.8) of an error compared to those in the lowest tertile. The personal accomplishment score was not associated with error risk.
Conclusion: Specific dimensions of physician burnout—emotional exhaustion and depersonalization—were significantly associated with an increased risk of diagnostic errors in the emergency department. These findings highlight that physician well-being is not merely a workforce issue but a critical component of patient safety infrastructure.
