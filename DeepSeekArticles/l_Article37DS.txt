Title: Chatbot-Delivered vs. Therapist-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression and Anxiety in University Students
Background: The demand for mental health services on university campuses far exceeds capacity. Digitally delivered therapies, including those powered by artificial intelligence, offer a potential scalable solution, but their effectiveness compared to traditional therapy is unclear.
Methods: We conducted a randomized, assessor-blinded, non-inferiority trial with 300 university students experiencing moderate symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Participants were allocated to 8 weeks of CBT delivered via an AI-driven, text-based chatbot (Woebot), weekly video sessions with a licensed therapist, or a waitlist control. The primary outcomes were changes in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale at 8 weeks. The non-inferiority margin was set at 2.0 points.
Results: Both active interventions were superior to waitlist (P<0.001). Reductions in PHQ-9 scores were -5.8 points for the chatbot, -6.2 points for therapist-led CBT, and -1.1 points for waitlist. The difference between chatbot and therapist (-0.4 points) was within the non-inferiority margin (P=0.45). A similar pattern was seen for GAD-7 scores. Engagement, defined as completing all core modules, was significantly higher in the chatbot arm (95%) compared to the therapist arm (78%).
Conclusion: Chatbot-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy was non-inferior to therapist-delivered CBT for reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in a university student population, with superior engagement rates. This finding supports the role of AI-driven digital therapeutics as an accessible, scalable component of campus mental health services.
