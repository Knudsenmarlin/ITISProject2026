Title: Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Surveillance for Early Recurrence Detection after Thermal Ablation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Background: Post-ablation surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma is critical, typically relying on cross-sectional imaging. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a highly sensitive, real-time, and low-cost modality, but its role in routine surveillance schedules is not standardized.
Methods: In this prospective, single-center study, 250 patients who achieved complete ablation of HCC were enrolled in a surveillance protocol alternating contrast-enhanced ultrasound and MRI every 3 months for 2 years. The primary endpoint was the time to detection of local tumor progression or intrahepatic distant recurrence. The sensitivity of each modality for detecting recurrence was compared, and the lead time provided by CEUS over scheduled MRI was calculated.
Results: CEUS detected recurrence earlier than the next scheduled MRI in 22% of patients (28 of 128 recurrence events), with a median lead time of 45 days. Per-patient sensitivity for local tumor progression was 95% for CEUS versus 90% for MRI, and for intrahepatic distant recurrence it was 88% versus 92%. The combined use of both modalities achieved a sensitivity of 99%. Earlier detection via CEUS led to a higher proportion of patients receiving curative-intent salvage therapy (75% vs. 60% in the MRI-first detection group; P=0.04).
Conclusion: Incorporating contrast-enhanced ultrasound into a multimodal surveillance schedule after HCC ablation facilitates earlier detection of recurrence, enabling more timely and potentially curative salvage treatments. CEUS represents a valuable adjunct to MRI in high-frequency surveillance protocols.
