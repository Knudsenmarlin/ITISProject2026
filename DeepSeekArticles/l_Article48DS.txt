Title: Clinical Utility and Cost of Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing in the Neonatal ICU
Background: Rapid whole genome sequencing can diagnose genetic disorders in critically ill infants in days, but its real-world impact on clinical management and cost in a diverse NICU population requires rigorous evaluation.
Methods: In the RAPID-NICU study, we offered trio rWGS (<5-day turnaround) to 150 consecutive NICU infants with diseases of suspected genetic etiology. A multidisciplinary review board determined the clinical actionability of results. The primary outcomes were changes in clinical management prompted by a diagnosis. A within-trial cost analysis was performed from the hospital perspective, comparing the cost of testing to cost savings from averted procedures and optimized care.
Results: A molecular diagnosis was achieved in 45% of infants (68/150). In 78% of diagnosed cases (53/68), the result led to a change in management, including avoidance of planned surgeries, initiation of targeted therapy, or redirection to palliative care. The median time to diagnosis was 4 days. The incremental cost per diagnosis was offset by substantial reductions in unnecessary diagnostic tests, imaging, and invasive procedures, resulting in a net estimated cost savings of $3,200 per infant tested.
Conclusion: Rapid whole genome sequencing in the NICU had a high diagnostic yield, frequently altered clinical management, and was cost-saving from an institutional perspective. This study demonstrates that rWGS is not only a powerful diagnostic tool but also an economically viable intervention that promotes precision medicine in neonatal critical care.
