Title: Long-Term Cardiovascular Safety of Testosterone Replacement Therapy: 5-Year Follow-up of the TRAVERSE Trial
Background: The TRAVERSE trial demonstrated no increased short-term major adverse cardiovascular event risk with testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men with preexisting cardiovascular disease or high risk. Long-term safety beyond the trial period remains a key clinical question.
Methods: This was a prospective, observational follow-up study of the TRAVERSE cohort. All eligible trial participants were followed for an additional 5 years post-trial. The primary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). Secondary outcomes included heart failure hospitalization, atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer incidence.
Results: Over a median total follow-up of 8 years (3-year trial plus 5-year observation), the incidence of the primary MACE endpoint was 12.5% in the testosterone group and 13.0% in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.96; 95% CI 0.85–1.09; P=0.54). Rates of heart failure hospitalization, atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer were also not significantly different between the groups. Results were consistent across age and cardiovascular risk subgroups.
Conclusion: In hypogonadal men at increased cardiovascular risk, testosterone therapy was not associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or prostate cancer over 8 years of follow-up. These findings provide robust, long-term reassurance regarding the cardiovascular safety of testosterone replacement when appropriately prescribed.
