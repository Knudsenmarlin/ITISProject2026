Title: A Dual GLP-1/GIP Receptor Agonist for Obesity and Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Phase II Study
Background: Weight loss is a cornerstone of therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with obesity. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists induce substantial weight reduction, but their direct impact on OSA severity is not well established.
Methods: This 40-week, open-label, single-arm phase II study enrolled 120 adults with obesity (body-mass index ≥30) and moderate-to-severe OSA, defined by an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 15 or more events per hour, who were intolerant of or non-adherent to continuous positive airway pressure therapy. All participants received once-weekly subcutaneous injections of the dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist tirzepatide. The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change in the AHI from baseline to week 40. Secondary endpoints included percent change in body weight, scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and measures of nocturnal hypoxic burden.
Results: After 40 weeks of treatment, the mean AHI decreased dramatically from 38.2 events per hour to 14.6 events per hour, representing a 61.8% reduction (P<0.0001). Participants achieved a mean weight loss of 20.3% of their baseline body weight. Concomitant significant improvements were observed in subjective sleepiness (ESS) and objective measures of overnight oxygen desaturation. Gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea and diarrhea, were common but typically transient and mild to moderate in severity.
Conclusion: Treatment with the dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist tirzepatide resulted in a profound reduction in the severity of obstructive sleep apnea among patients with obesity, an effect likely mediated through the agent’s potent weight-loss properties. This pharmacologic approach represents a promising therapeutic strategy for this difficult-to-manage comorbid condition.
