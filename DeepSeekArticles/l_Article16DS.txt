Title: A Novel Oral Polymerase Inhibitor for High-Risk Outpatients with Influenza: A Phase II Trial
Background: The therapeutic arsenal for influenza is limited, primarily reliant on neuraminidase inhibitors. The emergence of resistance and modest efficacy in high-risk populations underscores the need for new antiviral agents with novel mechanisms of action.
Methods: We conducted a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Within 48 hours of symptom onset, 360 adult outpatients with laboratory-confirmed influenza and at least one high-risk condition (age ≥65 years, chronic cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes, immunosuppression) were enrolled. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either VNRX-9945, a novel cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, at a dose of 600 mg twice daily, or a matched placebo, for 5 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to alleviation of all seven prespecified influenza symptoms. Secondary endpoints included the magnitude and kinetics of viral shedding, and the incidence of influenza-related complications.
Results: The median time to symptom alleviation was 78 hours in the VNRX-9945 group, compared to 102 hours in the placebo group, a difference of 24 hours (P=0.003). The reduction in viral RNA load, as measured by quantitative PCR, was significantly more rapid in the active treatment arm. Furthermore, influenza-related complications, including pneumonia and hospitalization, occurred in only 2% of patients receiving VNRX-9945, compared to 7% in the placebo group (P=0.04). The investigational drug was generally well-tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to placebo.
Conclusion: The novel polymerase inhibitor VNRX-9945 significantly shortened the duration of influenza symptoms and reduced complication rates in a high-risk outpatient population. These encouraging efficacy and safety data support the advancement of this agent into pivotal phase III clinical development.
