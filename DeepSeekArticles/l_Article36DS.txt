Title: Intra-articular Injection of Autologous Microfragmented Adipose Tissue for Knee Osteoarthritis: 12-Month Results
Background: Orthobiologic interventions are of growing interest for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Microfragmented adipose tissue is a minimally manipulated, autologous product rich in mesenchymal stromal cells and anti-inflammatory mediators, but high-quality clinical data are needed.
Methods: In this phase I/II, single-arm, open-label study, 30 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3) received a single intra-articular injection of autologous, minimally manipulated microfragmented adipose tissue harvested from abdominal subcutaneous fat. The primary outcomes were safety and change in the pain subscale of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the full WOMAC score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, quantitative MRI for cartilage assessment, and the 6-minute walk test.
Results: The procedure was safe, with adverse events limited to minor, transient injection-site pain. At 12 months, the mean WOMAC pain score improved from 65 to 32 (on a 0–100 scale; P<0.0001). Significant improvements were also observed in all other WOMAC and KOOS subscales and in 6-minute walk distance. Quantitative MRI analysis showed no significant progression of cartilage loss in the index compartment. 80% of patients met the OMERACT-OARSI responder criteria at 12 months.
Conclusion: A single intra-articular injection of autologous microfragmented adipose tissue was safe and associated with significant and sustained improvements in pain, function, and quality of life at 12 months in patients with moderate knee osteoarthritis. These promising results warrant further investigation in larger, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.
