Title: Universal vs. Targeted MRSA Decolonization before Orthopedic Implant Surgery: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
Background: Prosthetic joint infection is a devastating complication of arthroplasty. While decolonization of Staphylococcus aureus carriers reduces infection risk, the most cost-effective strategy—targeting only carriers or treating all patients—is debated.
Methods: We performed a prospective economic evaluation alongside the CLEAR trial, a cluster-randomized study in 10,000 patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty. Hospitals were randomized to universal decolonization (5 days of chlorhexidine baths and nasal mupirocin for all patients) or a targeted strategy (nasal screening for MRSA, decolonizing carriers only). The analysis calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per prosthetic joint infection (PJI) prevented and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over a 2-year time horizon, from both hospital and societal perspectives.
Results: The universal strategy prevented 23 more PJIs per 10,000 patients compared to the targeted strategy. From the hospital perspective, universal decolonization was cost-saving, reducing costs by $185 per patient due to averting expensive infection-related readmissions. From the broader societal perspective, universal decolonization was a dominant strategy, meaning it was both less costly and more effective (yielded more QALYs) than the targeted approach.
Conclusion: Universal preoperative decolonization is a cost-saving or dominant strategy compared to a screen-and-treat approach for preventing prosthetic joint infection in elective arthroplasty. These findings support the implementation of universal decolonization protocols as a standard of care to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.
