Title: High-Flow Nasal Cannula vs. CPAP as Initial Respiratory Support for Premature Infants 28-32 Weeks Gestation
Background: Continuous positive airway pressure is the standard initial non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. High-flow nasal cannula is increasingly used due to perceived comfort and ease of use, but comparative effectiveness data for moderate preterms are limited.
Methods: The SOFT-BREATHE trial randomized 600 infants born at 28+0 to 31+6 weeks’ gestation requiring respiratory support to initial support with HFNC (6–8 L/min) or CPAP (6 cm H2O). The primary outcome was treatment failure within 72 hours, defined by strict criteria for intubation or crossover to the other modality. Secondary outcomes included pneumothorax, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, nasal trauma, and caregiver satisfaction.
Results: Treatment failure occurred in 25% of the HFNC group versus 15% of the CPAP group (relative risk 1.67; 95% CI 1.21–2.30; P=0.002). The need for intubation was higher in the HFNC group (12% vs. 7%; P=0.03). Rates of pneumothorax, BPD, and nasal trauma were similar. Parental and nurse satisfaction scores were significantly higher for HFNC.
Conclusion: For initial respiratory support in infants 28–32 weeks’ gestation, CPAP was more effective than HFNC in preventing treatment failure and intubation, despite lower satisfaction scores. These findings support CPAP as the preferred first-line modality for this population, though HFNC may remain an option for milder disease or where CPAP is not tolerated.
