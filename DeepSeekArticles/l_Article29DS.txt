Title: Ultra-Processed Food Consumption and Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study
Background: Dietary factors are suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Ultra-processed foods, rich in additives and poor in fiber, may influence gut health, but prospective data are limited.
Methods: We analyzed data from 146,487 participants in the UK Biobank, aged 40–69 years and free of IBD at baseline. Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour recalls and categorized according to the NOVA classification system. Incident cases of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis were identified through linkage to national hospital admission and registry data. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for demographics, smoking, body mass index, and other dietary factors.
Results: Over a median follow-up of 12 years, 467 incident cases of Crohn’s disease and 890 of ulcerative colitis occurred. Participants in the highest quartile of ultra-processed food consumption had a significantly higher risk of Crohn’s disease (HR 1.82; 95% CI 1.32–2.52; P-trend<0.001) and a modestly higher risk of ulcerative colitis (HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.02–1.60; P-trend=0.03) compared to the lowest quartile. Each 10% increment in calorie intake from ultra-processed foods was associated with a 15% increased risk of Crohn’s disease.
Conclusion: Higher consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with an increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn’s disease, in a large prospective cohort. These findings highlight a potential modifiable environmental risk factor for IBD.
