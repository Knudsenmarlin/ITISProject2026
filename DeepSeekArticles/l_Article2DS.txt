Title: Efficacy of Digital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in Patients with Comorbid Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Background: Insomnia and generalized anxiety disorder exhibit a high degree of comorbidity, each exacerbating the other. Integrated, accessible treatment models are needed.
Methods: In this 10-week randomized controlled trial, 300 adult participants with formally diagnosed insomnia disorder and comorbid generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were assigned to one of two groups. The intervention group received access to a fully automated, interactive digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) platform. The active control group received standardized online sleep hygiene education materials. The co-primary outcomes were the change in scores on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) from baseline to the 10-week endpoint. Secondary outcomes included objective measures of sleep efficiency via wrist actigraphy and changes in dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep.
Results: Participants in the dCBT-I arm demonstrated significantly greater reductions in both insomnia and anxiety severity compared to the control arm. The mean difference in ISI score change was -4.8 points (P<0.001), and the mean difference in GAD-7 score change was -3.2 points (P<0.001). Objectively measured sleep efficiency improved by 18 percentage points in the dCBT-I group, versus a 5-point improvement in the sleep hygiene group (P<0.001). All treatment gains were maintained at a 6-month follow-up assessment.
Conclusion: A standalone, digitally delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program specifically designed for insomnia was effective not only for its primary target but also for meaningfully reducing symptoms of co-occurring generalized anxiety. This suggests the intervention confers transdiagnostic psychological benefits and offers a scalable solution for managing this common comorbidity.
