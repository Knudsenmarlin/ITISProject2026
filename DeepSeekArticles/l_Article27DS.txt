Title: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Prevention of Perinatal Depression in High-Risk Women
Background: Women with a history of major depressive disorder are at markedly elevated risk for recurrence during the perinatal period. Effective, accessible preventive interventions are a critical unmet need.
Methods: In the MINDFUL-MOM trial, 200 pregnant women (less than 20 weeks’ gestation) with a history of at least one prior major depressive episode were randomized to an 8-week antenatal Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy course, adapted for pregnancy, or to treatment-as-usual. The primary outcome was the incidence of a major depressive episode, as diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, from randomization through 6 months postpartum. Secondary outcomes included depressive symptom severity and perceived stress.
Results: The incidence of a major depressive episode was 18% in the MBCT group, compared to 34% in the treatment-as-usual group (relative risk, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32–0.87; P=0.01). Participants in the MBCT group also reported significantly lower depressive symptom scores on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale across the perinatal period and lower levels of perceived stress. No between-group differences were observed in obstetric or neonatal outcomes.
Conclusion: Antenatal Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy is an effective psychological intervention for preventing depressive relapse in pregnant women at high risk due to prior depression. This group-based approach offers a non-pharmacologic strategy to safeguard maternal mental health during a vulnerable life transition.
