Title: The Impact of Preoperative Multimodal Prehabilitation on Outcomes after Major Abdominal Cancer Surgery
Background: Major oncologic surgery induces a profound catabolic stress response that can deplete physiological reserves, increasing vulnerability to postoperative complications. Prehabilitation aims to enhance functional capacity before this stressor.
Methods: In this single-center, assessor-blinded randomized trial, 240 patients scheduled for elective curative-intent resection of colorectal or pancreatic adenocarcinoma were enrolled. Participants were randomized to either a 4-week, structured multimodal prehabilitation program or to standard preoperative care. The intervention consisted of three core components: supervised, moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercise; daily high-protein oral nutritional supplementation enriched with immunonutrients (arginine, omega-3 fatty acids); and mindfulness-based anxiety reduction techniques. The primary outcome was the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) at 30 days postoperatively, which quantifies the cumulative burden of all complications.
Results: The prehabilitation group experienced a significantly lower burden of postoperative morbidity, with a median CCI of 8.6 compared to 20.9 in the standard care group (P=0.003). This was driven by a reduction in severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher: 11% vs. 24%; P=0.02) and a shorter median length of hospital stay (6 days vs. 8 days; P=0.01). Furthermore, the intervention group demonstrated better preservation of lean body mass and a smaller decline in functional walking capacity as measured by the 6-minute walk test.
Conclusion: A structured, multimodal prehabilitation program incorporating physical, nutritional, and psychological components significantly reduced the overall burden and severity of complications following major abdominal cancer surgery. This intervention represents a proactive strategy to optimize patient resilience and improve surgical outcomes.
