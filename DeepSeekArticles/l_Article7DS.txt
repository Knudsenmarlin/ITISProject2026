Title: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Migraine Prevention: A Randomized Clinical Trial
Background: Behavioral interventions are recommended for migraine prevention, but high-quality evidence supporting mindfulness-based approaches is limited.
Methods: One hundred adults diagnosed with episodic migraine, experiencing between 4 and 14 headache days per month, were enrolled in this parallel-group randomized trial. Participants were assigned to either a standard 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course, delivered in a group format by a certified instructor, or to an active control condition consisting of stress management education (SME). The primary outcome was the change in the number of monthly migraine days from a 4-week prospective baseline period to weeks 9 through 12 (the primary endpoint period). Secondary outcomes included changes in headache-related disability measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment and in quality of life.
Results: From baseline to the primary endpoint, the MBSR group experienced a significantly greater reduction in monthly migraine days (-3.2 days) compared to the SME group (-1.4 days). The between-group difference was -1.8 days (95% CI, -2.7 to -0.9; P<0.001). Participants in the MBSR arm also demonstrated significantly greater improvements in migraine-related disability and in scores on a measure of pain catastrophizing. No serious adverse events related to the intervention were reported.
Conclusion: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction was more effective than standardized stress management education in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks and associated disability. These findings support MBSR as a viable, evidence-based non-pharmacological option for the preventive management of episodic migraine.
