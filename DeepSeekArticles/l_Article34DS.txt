Title: Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygen Therapy in Mechanically Ventilated Patients with Sepsis
Background: Both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia may be harmful in critically ill patients. The optimal oxygen saturation target for mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock is unknown.
Methods: In this multicenter randomized trial, 500 adults with septic shock requiring mechanical ventilation were randomized within 6 hours of ICU admission to conservative oxygen therapy (target SpO2 90–92% or PaO2 60–70 mm Hg) or liberal oxygen therapy (target SpO2 96–98% or PaO2 90–110 mm Hg). Oxygen protocols were maintained for up to 14 days or until extubation. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality.
Results: Mortality at 28 days was 34% in the conservative group and 32% in the liberal group (absolute difference 2%; 95% CI −6 to 10; P=0.62). The conservative group experienced more episodes of severe hypoxemia (SpO2 <85%; 8% vs. 3%; P=0.02), while the liberal group had more episodes of hyperoxemia (PaO2 >120 mm Hg; 45% vs. 12%; P<0.001). There were no significant differences in ventilator-free days, new organ failures, or ICU length of stay.
Conclusion: Among mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock, a conservative oxygen-saturation target did not reduce 28-day mortality compared to a liberal target. The higher incidence of severe hypoxemia with the conservative strategy and of hyperoxemia with the liberal strategy suggests a narrow therapeutic window, advocating for careful titration and avoidance of extremes.
