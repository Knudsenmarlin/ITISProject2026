Title: Impact of a "Team Time-Out" Enhanced Surgical Safety Checklist on OR Communication and Safety Culture
Background: While surgical safety checklists improve patient outcomes, their impact on team dynamics and communication—key determinants of safety—is less well characterized. A structured "Team Time-Out" may enhance these factors.
Methods: We conducted a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial implementing an enhanced surgical safety checklist across 12 operating rooms over 12 months. The enhancement was a mandatory 2-minute "Team Time-Out" immediately before incision, dedicated to discussing the operative plan, potential challenges, and team member roles. Outcomes were assessed via (1) direct, blinded observation of communication quality (e.g., frequency of clarifying questions, speaking up) and (2) the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire administered to OR staff before and after implementation.
Results: Analysis of 600 observed cases showed a 40% increase in high-quality, proactive communication in the post-implementation period (P<0.001). The SAQ teamwork climate score improved from 68 to 78 (on a 100-point scale; P=0.002), and the safety climate score improved from 65 to 75 (P=0.001). Nurses and anesthesiologists reported the greatest perceived improvement in psychological safety to voice concerns. No change in patient complication rates was detected in this short-term study.
Conclusion: Enhancing a standard surgical safety checklist with a brief, structured "Team Time-Out" significantly improved intraoperative communication and staff perceptions of safety culture. This low-cost, high-impact modification underscores that checklist design can be optimized to foster teamwork as well as procedural compliance.
