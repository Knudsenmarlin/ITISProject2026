Title: Safety and Efficacy of a Bioengineered Human Acellular Vessel for Hemodialysis Access
Background: Patients with end-stage renal disease who have exhausted options for native arteriovenous fistulas face limited alternatives, often relying on tunneled catheters with associated risks of infection and central venous stenosis.
Methods: This phase IIb, single-arm study evaluated a bioengineered human acellular vessel in 60 patients with no suitable sites for native fistula creation. The 6-mm diameter vessel, derived from human vascular cells and decellularized, was implanted as an arteriovenous conduit. Primary endpoints were primary patency at 6 months and safety (freedom from infection, aneurysm, or rupture). Secondary endpoints included secondary patency and usability for dialysis.
Results: Primary patency at 6 months was 65%. Secondary patency was 88% at 12 months. No cases of HAV infection, aneurysm formation, or rupture occurred. The most common adverse event was stenosis requiring percutaneous intervention (28% of patients). At 6 months, 85% of implanted HAVs were being used successfully for dialysis, and the use of catheters in the cohort decreased by 92%.
Conclusion: The bioengineered human acellular vessel demonstrated promising patency and an excellent safety profile as a hemodialysis access conduit in a challenging patient population with no other options, offering a novel, biologically derived alternative to synthetic grafts.
