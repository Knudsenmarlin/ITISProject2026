Title: Tapering vs. Maintenance Dosing of Tofacitinib in Rheumatoid Arthritis Remission
Background: For patients with rheumatoid arthritis who achieve sustained remission on a Janus kinase inhibitor, the feasibility and outcomes of dose reduction or discontinuation are poorly understood, yet this is a common and important clinical question.
Methods: The TAPER trial was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. We enrolled 180 patients with RA who had been in sustained clinical remission (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate [DAS28-ESR] <2.6) for at least 6 months while receiving tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three strategies: continue full-dose tofacitinib, reduce dose to 5 mg once daily, or discontinue tofacitinib (switch to placebo). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients experiencing a disease flare, defined as an increase in DAS28-ESR of >1.2 or >0.6 if the resultant score was >3.2, within 12 months.
Results: At 12 months, flare rates were 15% in the full-dose maintenance group, 42% in the half-dose group, and 68% in the discontinuation group (P<0.001 for both tapering groups vs. full dose). The majority of flares in the reduced-dose groups were successfully recaptured upon resumption of the standard twice-daily dosing. No new or unexpected safety signals emerged during the tapering period.
Conclusion: While continuing standard-dose tofacitinib was the most effective strategy for maintaining remission, a dose reduction was successful in more than half of patients. Complete drug discontinuation, however, led to unacceptably high flare rates. These findings provide an evidence-based framework for shared decision-making regarding treatment intensity for patients in stable remission.
