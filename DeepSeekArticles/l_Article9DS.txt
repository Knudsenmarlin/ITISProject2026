Title: Fecal Microbiota Transplantation to Improve Insulin Sensitivity in Treatment-Naive Type 2 Diabetes
Background: Alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, but evidence of a causal relationship in humans is limited.
Methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial involving 60 adults with newly diagnosed, pharmacologically treatment-naive type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A1c level between 6.5% and 8.0%). Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single nasoduodenal infusion of fecal microbiota transplantation from a single, rigorously screened healthy lean donor or an infusion of their own fecal material (autologous transplant as placebo). The primary outcome was the change in peripheral insulin sensitivity, precisely measured by a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure, at 6 weeks after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included changes in glycemic control (HbA1c), gut microbiota composition (shotgun metagenomic sequencing), and systemic inflammatory markers.
Results: At the 6-week endpoint, peripheral insulin sensitivity increased by a mean of 25% in the donor FMT group, compared to a 5% increase in the placebo group (P=0.008). Glycemic control also improved, with a greater reduction in HbA1c observed in the donor FMT group (-0.7% vs. -0.2%; P=0.03). Metagenomic analysis confirmed successful engraftment of donor-derived microbial taxa in recipients, and the degree of engraftment correlated with the improvement in metabolic parameters. The procedure was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events.
Conclusion: Fecal microbiota transplantation from healthy lean donors significantly improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in individuals with recently diagnosed, treatment-naive type 2 diabetes. This study provides direct experimental evidence in humans supporting a causal role of the gut microbiota in regulating glucose metabolism.
