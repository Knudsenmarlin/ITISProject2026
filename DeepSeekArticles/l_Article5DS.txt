Title: Early Physical Therapy versus Usual Care for Acute Low Back Pain in the Emergency Department
Background: Acute low back pain is among the most common reasons for emergency department visits, yet evidence on the optimal initial management strategy to prevent chronicity and disability is limited and inconsistent.
Methods: We conducted a pragmatic randomized trial in a high-volume urban emergency department. Five hundred adult patients presenting with acute, non-traumatic, non-radicular low back pain of less than two weeks' duration were enrolled. They were randomized to receive either (1) an immediate, single-session evaluation and intervention by a physical therapist stationed in the ED, coupled with instruction in a standardized home exercise program, or (2) usual ED care, which consisted of analgesia, basic activity advice, and standard discharge instructions. The primary outcome was back-related functional disability as measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score at the 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity, subsequent opioid prescription use, and healthcare utilization for back pain over one year.
Results: At the 3-month primary endpoint, patients in the early physical therapy group reported significantly lower disability, with a mean RMDQ score of 4.1, compared to 6.8 in the usual care group (mean difference -2.7; 95% CI, -4.1 to -1.3; P<0.001). The intervention group also reported lower pain scores at the 1-week follow-up, received fewer opioid prescriptions (15% vs. 28%; P=0.002), and had a lower rate of return ED visits specifically for back pain over the following year.
Conclusion: Providing immediate access to physical therapy consultation and intervention within the emergency department setting for acute low back pain led to superior functional recovery at 3 months and was associated with reduced downstream opioid use and healthcare visits. This model presents a valuable opportunity to improve the trajectory of care for a prevalent and costly condition.
