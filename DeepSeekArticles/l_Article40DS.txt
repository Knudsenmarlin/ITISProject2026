Title: A Multifaceted Antimicrobial Stewardship Intervention for Uncomplicated Cystitis in the Emergency Department
Background: Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for uncomplicated cystitis, including the use of fluoroquinolones and excessively long durations, is common in the emergency department and contributes to antimicrobial resistance.
Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental study with a 6-month intervention period in a large academic ED. The intervention comprised three components: (1) clinical decision support integrated into the electronic health record favoring nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as first-line agents, (2) confidential peer comparison feedback reports to prescribers, and (3) standardized patient education handouts. Using interrupted time series analysis, we evaluated changes in the proportion of prescriptions for first-line antibiotics and in the proportion of prescriptions exceeding 5 days’ duration.
Results: Post-intervention, the rate of appropriate first-line antibiotic selection increased from 45% to 78% (P<0.001). Fluoroquinolone use decreased from 32% to 8%. The rate of prescriptions exceeding the recommended 5-day duration fell from 65% to 22%. These improvements were sustained throughout the 6-month post-intervention period and were not associated with an increase in 30-day return visits for treatment failure.
Conclusion: A low-cost, multifaceted antimicrobial stewardship intervention successfully improved antibiotic selection and reduced excessive treatment duration for uncomplicated cystitis in the emergency department. This model demonstrates that behaviorally informed strategies can be effectively implemented in a high-volume, time-pressured setting to promote better prescribing.
