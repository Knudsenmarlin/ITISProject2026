Title: A Phase II Study of a BET Inhibitor in Relapsed/Refractory AML with Chromatin Regulator Mutations
Background: Inhibition of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins represents a novel therapeutic strategy in acute myeloid leukemia, with preclinical data suggesting particular efficacy in subsets harboring mutations in chromatin regulators such as ASXL1.
Methods: This was an open-label, single-arm, phase II trial. We enrolled 55 adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML who possessed mutations in ASXL1, EZH2, or MLL (KMT2A) genes. Participants received oral BMS-986158, a selective BET inhibitor, on a daily schedule in 28-day cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite complete remission rate (CRc, comprising complete remission and complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery). Key secondary endpoints included duration of response, overall survival, and safety. Exploratory analyses involved RNA sequencing of pre- and post-treatment samples to assess on-target transcriptional modulation.
Results: The overall composite complete remission rate was 29% (16 of 55 patients). Clinical activity was most pronounced in the ASXL1-mutant subgroup, which achieved a CRc of 38%. The median duration of composite remission was 8.1 months, and the median overall survival for responders was 15.4 months. The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events were consistent with the underlying disease and included thrombocytopenia (42%), anemia (36%), and febrile neutropenia (24%). Transcriptional analyses confirmed significant downregulation of key oncogenic pathways, including MYC and BCL2, in patients who achieved a response.
Conclusion: The BET inhibitor BMS-986158 demonstrated clinically meaningful single-agent activity in a molecularly defined, high-risk population of patients with relapsed or refractory AML, validating BET proteins as a therapeutic target in this context. These results warrant further investigation in combination regimens or larger confirmatory studies.
