Title: A Rapid Host-Response Blood Test vs. Procalcitonin for Distinguishing Bacterial from Viral Infections in Febrile Children
Background: Accurately distinguishing bacterial from viral infections in febrile children is challenging and directly impacts antibiotic stewardship. Biomarkers like procalcitonin have limitations, creating a need for more accurate diagnostic tools.
Methods: In this prospective diagnostic study, we enrolled 1,000 febrile children (1 month–18 years) presenting to a pediatric emergency department. We measured a novel host-gene expression signature (SeptiCyte RAPID) and procalcitonin from blood collected on arrival. A multidisciplinary expert panel adjudicated the infection etiology (bacterial, viral, or non-infectious) using all clinical, laboratory, and follow-up data. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy, measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, for distinguishing bacterial from viral infection.
Results: Based on adjudication, 212 children had bacterial and 688 had viral infections. The host-response signature achieved an AUROC of 0.89 (95% CI 0.86–0.92), which was significantly superior to procalcitonin (AUROC 0.76; 95% CI 0.72–0.80; P<0.001). At a high-sensitivity threshold of 95%, the signature had a specificity of 62%, which would have theoretically reduced antibiotic prescriptions in the viral group by 45%.
Conclusion: A rapid host-response blood test was significantly more accurate than procalcitonin in distinguishing bacterial from viral illness in febrile children. This novel diagnostic approach has the potential to support clinical decision-making and improve antibiotic stewardship in pediatric emergency care.
