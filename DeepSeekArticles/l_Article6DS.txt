Title: Circulating Tumor DNA for Detection of Minimal Residual Disease in Stage II-III Colorectal Cancer
Background: The detection of minimal residual disease after surgery with curative intent could identify patients at the highest risk of recurrence, enabling personalized adjuvant therapy decisions.
Methods: In this prospective, multicenter cohort study, we analyzed serial plasma samples from 450 patients with stage II or stage III colorectal cancer. We utilized a targeted, tumor-informed next-generation sequencing panel focused on a predefined 5-gene signature (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, TP53). Blood draws were performed preoperatively, at 4 weeks post-operatively, and every 3 months thereafter for a total of 2 years. The primary endpoint was the association between post-operative ctDNA detection and radiographic recurrence-free survival, as determined by standard-of-care imaging.
Results: Following surgery, ctDNA was detectable in the plasma of 18% of patients (81 of 450). Post-operative ctDNA positivity was the most powerful prognostic factor for recurrence, with a hazard ratio of 12.4 (95% confidence interval 7.8 to 19.6; P<0.0001). The median lead time from ctDNA detection to radiographic confirmation of recurrence was 8.2 months. Notably, all patients who remained consistently ctDNA-negative throughout the surveillance period were also free of radiographic recurrence at the 24-month mark.
Conclusion: A focused, tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA assay robustly identified minimal residual disease following surgery for stage II-III colorectal cancer and accurately predicted subsequent clinical recurrence, often months before standard imaging. This technology holds significant promise for stratifying patients for adjuvant therapy escalation or de-escalation in future practice.
