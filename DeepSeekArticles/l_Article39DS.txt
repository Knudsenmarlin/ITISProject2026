Title: Buprenorphine vs. Methadone for Opioid Use Disorder in Pregnancy: Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes
Background: Both buprenorphine and methadone are recommended for the treatment of opioid use disorder in pregnancy, but comparative data on detailed neonatal outcomes are needed to better inform clinical choice.
Methods: In the MOTHER-2 trial, 175 pregnant women with opioid use disorder were randomized in an open-label, flexible-dosing study to receive buprenorphine or methadone. The primary neonatal outcome was the total dose of morphine (mg/kg) required to treat neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Secondary outcomes included peak Finnegan scores, duration of hospital stay, and maternal treatment retention at delivery.
Results: Infants born to mothers in the buprenorphine group required significantly less morphine for withdrawal treatment (mean 1.2 mg/kg vs. 3.4 mg/kg; P<0.001), had lower peak Finnegan scores (12.1 vs. 15.8; P=0.01), and had a shorter median length of hospital stay (10.5 days vs. 17.5 days; P=0.002). Maternal retention in treatment at delivery was similar between groups (78% for buprenorphine vs. 72% for methadone; P=0.40). The incidence of other maternal or obstetric adverse events did not differ significantly.
Conclusion: For the treatment of opioid use disorder in pregnancy, buprenorphine was associated with a less severe course of neonatal abstinence syndrome compared to methadone, as measured by morphine requirement and length of hospital stay. These neonatal benefits support buprenorphine as a first-line pharmacotherapy option in this population.
