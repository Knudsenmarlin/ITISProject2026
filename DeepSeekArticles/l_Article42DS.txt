Title: Primary Care-Embedded Health Coach Program for Obesity Management: A Pragmatic Trial
Background: Primary care is the frontline for obesity management, but time constraints and lack of specialized support limit effective treatment. Embedding non-physician health coaches may provide a scalable solution.
Methods: In the PATHWEIGH pragmatic trial, 18 primary care clinics were cluster-randomized to implement a health coach-led weight management program or to continue usual care. The program involved algorithm-guided medication initiation/titration and monthly health coaching calls for 12 months. Adult patients with obesity were enrolled (N=2,300). The primary outcome was percent weight loss at 12 months.
Results: At 12 months, patients in the intervention clinics lost 7.9% of their baseline body weight, compared to 1.2% in usual care clinics (difference 6.7%; P<0.001). The proportion achieving clinically significant (≥5%) weight loss was 58% in the intervention group versus 19% in the control group (P<0.001). The program was successfully integrated into clinic workflows with high fidelity. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the intervention arm, with no increase in serious adverse events.
Conclusion: An embedded health coach program using algorithm-guided pharmacotherapy resulted in substantial and clinically meaningful weight loss at scale in the primary care setting. This model addresses a key implementation gap and provides a practical, effective framework for managing obesity in routine practice.
