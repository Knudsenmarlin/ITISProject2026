Background
Type 2 diabetes remains a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with persistent residual risk despite optimised glycaemic and lipid control. Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated superior glycaemic control, substantial weight reduction, and favourable effects on multiple cardiometabolic risk factors compared with selective GLP-1 receptor agonists. The SURPASS-CVOT trial was designed to determine whether tirzepatide reduces major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk.
Methods
In this phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, event-driven cardiovascular outcome trial, 13 299 participants with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.0–10.5%) and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or ≥60 years of age with ≥3 cardiovascular risk factors were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide (titrated to 10 mg or 15 mg) or once-weekly subcutaneous dulaglutide 1.5 mg, in addition to standard-of-care therapy. The primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (3-point MACE). The trial was powered for non-inferiority (margin 1.3) with a hierarchical testing strategy for superiority. Median follow-up was 4.1 years.
Results
The primary composite endpoint occurred in 444 participants (6.7%) in the tirzepatide group and 568 participants (8.6%) in the dulaglutide group (hazard ratio 0.78; 95% CI 0.68–0.89; P<0.0001 for superiority). Tirzepatide demonstrated superiority for the 3-point MACE outcome, with consistent reductions across the individual components and prespecified subgroups. Significant improvements were observed in body weight (mean difference –11.9 kg vs dulaglutide), HbA1c (–1.9% vs –1.3%), systolic blood pressure, and lipid profile. The rates of serious adverse events were similar between groups; gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent with tirzepatide but predominantly occurred during dose escalation and were mostly mild to moderate.
Conclusions
Among adults with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, once-weekly tirzepatide was superior to dulaglutide in reducing the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. These findings, together with the pronounced improvements in weight and cardiometabolic risk factors, support the use of tirzepatide as a preferred therapy in this population for both glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk reduction.
