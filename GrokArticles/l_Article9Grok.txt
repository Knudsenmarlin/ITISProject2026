Background
Relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of therapy carries a poor prognosis, with limited durable responses to conventional chemoimmunotherapy. CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have transformed outcomes in this setting, but manufacturing complexity, logistical challenges, and toxicity limit broader access. Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel), a CD19-directed CAR T-cell product with a defined 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain and defined CD4/CD8 ratio, has shown high response rates with a favourable safety profile. The TRANSCEND NHL 001 trial evaluated liso-cel in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.
Methods
In this multicentre, phase 2, single-arm trial, 269 patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (including DLBCL not otherwise specified, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and transformed follicular lymphoma) who had received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy were treated with liso-cel at a target dose of 100×10⁶ CAR T cells after lymphodepletion. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) per independent review committee assessment using Lugano criteria. Key secondary endpoints included complete response (CR) rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety (including cytokine release syndrome [CRS] and neurological events). The efficacy analysis included all patients who received at least one dose of liso-cel with measurable disease at baseline.
Results
With a median follow-up of 17.8 months, the ORR was 73% (95% CI 67–78), with a CR rate of 53% (95% CI 47–59). Responses were durable, with median duration of response of 20.0 months (95% CI 10.5–not reached) and median duration of CR of not reached. Median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% CI 3.3–14.1), and median overall survival was 27.3 months (95% CI 16.2–not reached). CRS occurred in 42% of patients (grade ≥3 in 2%), and neurological events in 30% (grade ≥3 in 10%), with most events of low grade and self-limited. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Prolonged cytopenias were the most common grade ≥3 adverse event.
Conclusions
Lisocabtagene maraleucel demonstrated high rates of deep and durable responses with a manageable safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more prior therapies. These results support liso-cel as an effective treatment option in this high-risk population and highlight its favourable tolerability relative to other approved CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapies.
