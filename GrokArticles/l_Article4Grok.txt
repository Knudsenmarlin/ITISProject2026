Background
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), now termed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), is a leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality, yet no approved pharmacotherapy exists. Resmetirom, a liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor-β selective agonist, has shown reductions in hepatic fat, inflammation, and fibrosis in earlier trials. The MAESTRO-NASH trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of resmetirom in adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH and moderate to advanced fibrosis.
Methods
In this phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 966 adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH, fibrosis stage F2 or F3, and metabolic risk factors were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive oral resmetirom 80 mg, resmetirom 100 mg, or matching placebo once daily for 52 weeks. The two primary endpoints (assessed at week 52) were: (1) NASH resolution (including at least 2-point improvement in NAFLD Activity Score) without worsening of fibrosis, and (2) improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage without worsening of NASH. Liver biopsies were centrally read. Secondary endpoints included changes in liver stiffness, liver fat content, and non-invasive markers. The primary analysis used a modified intention-to-treat population excluding patients without baseline or week-52 biopsy.
Results
At week 52, NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis was achieved in 25.9% of patients in the 80 mg group, 29.8% in the 100 mg group, and 9.7% in the placebo group (P<0.0001 for both resmetirom doses vs placebo). Fibrosis improvement by ≥1 stage without worsening of NASH occurred in 24.2% (80 mg), 25.9% (100 mg), and 14.2% (placebo) of patients (P=0.0002 and P<0.0001, respectively). Both doses significantly reduced liver fat content (by MRI-PDFF), liver stiffness (by vibration-controlled transient elastography), and circulating markers of inflammation and fibrosis. Diarrhoea and nausea were the most common adverse events, occurring more frequently with resmetirom (mainly mild to moderate and transient). Serious adverse events were balanced across groups; no clinically significant excess of cardiovascular or hepatic events was observed.
Conclusions
In adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH and moderate to advanced fibrosis, daily oral resmetirom (80 mg and 100 mg) significantly improved both NASH resolution and fibrosis regression compared with placebo. These findings, together with improvements in non-invasive markers of disease activity, support resmetirom as a potential first-in-class therapy for patients with non-cirrhotic MASH with significant fibrosis.
