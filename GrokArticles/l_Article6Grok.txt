Background
Obesity is a chronic disease associated with substantial morbidity, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and reduced quality of life. Current pharmacotherapies often achieve only modest weight loss, and many patients regain weight after discontinuation. Retatrutide, a novel triple-hormone receptor agonist targeting GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors, has demonstrated robust weight reduction in phase 2 studies. The TRIUMPH-1 trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of retatrutide in adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities.
Methods
In this phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 2 526 adults with body mass index ≥30 kg/m², or ≥27 kg/m² with at least one weight-related comorbidity (excluding diabetes), were randomly assigned (2:1:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous retatrutide (4 mg, 8 mg, or 12 mg, with dose escalation) or matching placebo for 48 weeks, in addition to lifestyle intervention. The primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight from baseline to week 48 and the proportion of participants achieving ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15%, and ≥20% weight loss. Key secondary endpoints included changes in waist circumference, cardiometabolic risk factors, and patient-reported outcomes. The primary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population using a mixed model for repeated measures.
Results
At week 48, the mean percentage change in body weight was –17.5% (95% CI –18.4 to –16.6) with retatrutide 12 mg, –16.1% (–17.0 to –15.2) with 8 mg, –12.9% (–13.8 to –12.0) with 4 mg, and –2.0% (–2.7 to –1.3) with placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons vs placebo). The proportions achieving ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15%, and ≥20% weight loss were significantly higher with all retatrutide doses (12 mg: 97%, 89%, 73%, and 53%, respectively) compared with placebo (all P<0.001). Retatrutide treatment resulted in greater reductions in waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol, and HbA1c, as well as improvements in physical functioning and weight-related quality of life. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting), predominantly mild to moderate, occurring mainly during dose escalation. Discontinuation due to adverse events was 6–10% across retatrutide groups versus 2% with placebo. Serious adverse events were balanced across groups.
Conclusions
In adults with obesity or overweight with comorbidities, once-weekly retatrutide achieved substantial, dose-dependent weight loss of up to 17.5% at 48 weeks, with high proportions reaching clinically meaningful weight reduction thresholds. These effects were accompanied by broad improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and quality of life, with an acceptable safety profile. Retatrutide represents a promising new therapeutic option for the management of obesity.
