Background
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease that progresses to cirrhosis, liver failure, and need for transplantation in a substantial proportion of patients despite treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Elafibranor, a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α/δ agonist, has demonstrated anti-cholestatic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects in earlier studies. The ELATIVE trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elafibranor in patients with PBC who have an inadequate response to or intolerance of UDCA.
Methods
In this international, phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 161 adults with PBC (alkaline phosphatase [ALP] ≥1.67× upper limit of normal [ULN] and/or total bilirubin ≤2× ULN despite ≥12 months of stable UDCA, or intolerant to UDCA) were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral elafibranor 80 mg once daily or matching placebo for 52 weeks, in addition to continued UDCA (or no UDCA in intolerant patients). The primary composite endpoint was biochemical response at week 52, defined as ALP <1.67× ULN with ≥15% reduction from baseline and total bilirubin ≤ ULN. Key secondary endpoints included normalisation of ALP, change in pruritus (using the Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale), fatigue, liver stiffness, and safety. The primary analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population.
Results
At week 52, 51% of patients in the elafibranor group achieved the primary composite biochemical response compared with 12% in the placebo group (difference 39%; 95% CI 25–52; P<0.0001). Normalisation of ALP occurred in 15% versus 0% (P=0.002), and elafibranor significantly reduced pruritus severity (least-squares mean difference in change from baseline –1.8 points; 95% CI –2.9 to –0.7; P=0.002) and improved fatigue scores. Reductions in liver stiffness and markers of cholestasis and inflammation were also observed. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate; the most common treatment-emergent events with elafibranor were abdominal pain (20% vs 10%), diarrhoea (15% vs 6%), and nausea (14% vs 8%). Serious adverse events occurred at similar rates (7% vs 6%), with no excess of liver-related events or deaths.
Conclusions
In patients with PBC and inadequate response to or intolerance of UDCA, elafibranor 80 mg once daily significantly improved biochemical markers of cholestasis, reduced pruritus, and showed a favourable safety profile over 52 weeks. These findings support elafibranor as an effective second-line therapy for PBC, addressing both biochemical disease activity and key patient-reported symptoms.
