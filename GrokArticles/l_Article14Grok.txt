Background
Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infectious diarrhoea, with high rates of recurrence despite standard antibiotic therapy. Current treatments do not restore the protective gut microbiota, contributing to recurrence rates of 20–30% after the first episode and up to 65% after multiple recurrences. Ridinilazole, a novel narrow-spectrum antibiotic with potent activity against C. difficile and minimal impact on the commensal gut microbiota, showed promise in phase 2 studies for reducing recurrence. The RiCoDIFy 1 and RiCoDIFy 2 trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ridinilazole compared with vancomycin in patients with initial or recurrent CDI.
Methods
In two identical, international, phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trials (RiCoDIFy 1: n=759; RiCoDIFy 2: n=714), adults with confirmed CDI (first episode or first recurrence) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral ridinilazole 200 mg twice daily or oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained clinical response (SCR) at 30 days after end of treatment, defined as clinical cure at end of treatment without recurrence through day 30 post-treatment. Key secondary endpoints included clinical cure at end of treatment, recurrence rate, microbiota diversity, and safety. The primary analysis was performed in the modified intention-to-treat population using a non-inferiority margin of –10% followed by superiority testing.
Results
In the pooled analysis, SCR was achieved in 73.8% of patients in the ridinilazole group versus 60.7% in the vancomycin group (difference 13.1%; 95% CI 7.6–18.6; P<0.0001 for superiority). Ridinilazole was non-inferior and superior to vancomycin for SCR in both individual trials. Clinical cure rates at end of treatment were comparable (ridinilazole 85.1% vs vancomycin 86.4%). Recurrence rates were significantly lower with ridinilazole (14.2% vs 28.9%; P<0.0001). Ridinilazole preserved greater gut microbiota diversity and abundance of beneficial taxa compared with vancomycin. Adverse events were similar between groups; the most common treatment-emergent events were gastrointestinal (nausea 12.4% vs 11.8%, diarrhoea 8.7% vs 9.3%), mostly mild to moderate. Serious adverse events occurred in 6.2% versus 7.1%.
Conclusions
In patients with initial or first recurrent C. difficile infection, ridinilazole was superior to vancomycin in achieving sustained clinical response, driven by a marked reduction in recurrence, while preserving gut microbiota composition. These findings, together with a comparable safety profile, support ridinilazole as a potential new standard-of-care treatment that addresses both acute infection and recurrence risk in CDI.
