Background:
Obesity is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, yet few interventions have demonstrated a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among individuals with overweight or obesity without diabetes. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has shown substantial weight loss and metabolic benefits in previous trials. This study aimed to evaluate whether once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with established cardiovascular disease and overweight or obesity.
Methods:
In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (SELECT), 17,604 patients (aged ≥45 years) with preexisting cardiovascular disease and body mass index ≥27 kg/m², without a history of diabetes, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or matching placebo once weekly, in addition to standard care. The primary composite endpoint was the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (MACE). Key secondary endpoints included expanded cardiovascular outcomes, heart failure events, and all-cause mortality. Patients were followed for a median of 39.8 months. Analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population using Cox proportional-hazards models.
Results:
Over the trial period, the primary endpoint occurred in 569 patients (6.5%) in the semaglutide group and 701 patients (8.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72–0.90; P<0.001), corresponding to a 20% relative risk reduction. Significant reductions were observed in nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke components, with consistent benefits across prespecified subgroups. Semaglutide treatment was associated with greater weight loss (mean difference -9.4% vs placebo), improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors (including glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure, and lipids), and fewer serious adverse events related to heart failure. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation (semaglutide 4.5% vs placebo 1.2%).
Conclusions:
In patients with overweight or obesity and preexisting cardiovascular disease but without diabetes, once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg significantly reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with placebo. These findings support the use of semaglutide as an adjunct to standard care for cardiovascular risk reduction in this high-risk population.
