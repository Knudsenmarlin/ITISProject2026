Background
Multiple myeloma remains an incurable haematologic malignancy, with high rates of relapse despite advances in therapy. Patients with triple-class refractory disease (refractory to proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies) have particularly poor outcomes. Teclistamab, a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) × CD3 bispecific T-cell engager antibody, has shown deep and durable responses in heavily pretreated patients. The MajesTEC-1 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of teclistamab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, including those with triple-class refractory disease.
Methods
In this multicentre, phase 1/2, open-label, single-arm study, 165 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least three prior lines of therapy (including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 antibody) received teclistamab subcutaneously at the recommended phase 2 dose (step-up doses of 0.06 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg, followed by 1.5 mg/kg once weekly). The primary endpoint in phase 2 was overall response rate (ORR; partial response or better) per International Myeloma Working Group criteria, assessed by independent review committee. Key secondary endpoints included complete response or better, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. The analysis included all patients who received at least one dose of teclistamab.
Results
At a median follow-up of 22.1 months, the ORR was 63.0% (95% CI 55.0–70.6), with 39.4% achieving complete response or better and 28.5% achieving stringent complete response. Responses were durable, with a median duration of response of 18.4 months (95% CI 14.9–not estimable). Median progression-free survival was 11.3 months (95% CI 8.8–17.1), and median overall survival was 22.2 months (95% CI 17.5–not estimable). Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 72.1% of patients (mostly grade 1 or 2, confined to step-up dosing); neurotoxicity (including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome) occurred in 3.0%. Infections were common (all-grade 81.8%; grade ≥3 50.9%), with opportunistic infections in a minority. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was infrequent (7.3%).
Conclusions
Teclistamab demonstrated clinically meaningful, deep, and durable responses in patients with heavily pretreated, triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, including those with triple-class refractory disease. The safety profile was consistent with T-cell redirection therapy and manageable with appropriate monitoring and supportive care. These results support teclistamab as an important new treatment option for patients with advanced multiple myeloma with limited remaining therapeutic alternatives.
