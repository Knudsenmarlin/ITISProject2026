Background
Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease affecting millions of women, causing severe pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, and infertility. Current treatments, including hormonal therapies and surgery, often provide incomplete symptom relief or are limited by side effects and recurrence. Linzagolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, has shown promise in reducing endometriosis-associated pain with a favourable safety profile. The EDELWEISS 3 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of linzagolix in women with moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.
Methods
In this international, phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 486 women aged 18–49 years with surgically confirmed endometriosis and moderate to severe dysmenorrhoea and non-menstrual pelvic pain were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive oral linzagolix 75 mg once daily with add-back therapy (1 mg estradiol + 0.5 mg norethisterone acetate), linzagolix 200 mg once daily with add-back therapy, or matching placebo for 24 weeks. The two primary endpoints (assessed at week 12) were: (1) proportion of responders with ≥30% reduction in dysmenorrhoea and (2) proportion of responders with ≥30% reduction in non-menstrual pelvic pain, both with stable or reduced analgesic use. Key secondary endpoints included dyspareunia, overall pelvic pain, quality of life (Endometriosis Health Profile-30), and safety. The primary analysis used a logistic regression model in the intention-to-treat population.
Results
At week 12, the proportion of dysmenorrhoea responders was 75.2% with linzagolix 200 mg + add-back, 66.4% with 75 mg + add-back, and 36.8% with placebo (P<0.0001 for both doses vs placebo). Non-menstrual pelvic pain responders were 52.8%, 48.5%, and 29.4%, respectively (P<0.0001 and P=0.0002). Benefits were sustained through week 24, with significant improvements in dyspareunia, overall pain, and quality-of-life scores. Both doses rapidly suppressed oestradiol to therapeutic levels while add-back therapy maintained bone mineral density. The most common adverse events with linzagolix were hot flushes (mostly mild to moderate), headache, and arthralgia; rates of serious adverse events were low and similar across groups. Discontinuation due to adverse events was 4.9–6.8% with linzagolix versus 3.7% with placebo.
Conclusions
In women with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain, oral linzagolix 75 mg and 200 mg once daily with hormonal add-back therapy significantly reduced dysmenorrhoea and non-menstrual pelvic pain compared with placebo, with rapid onset, sustained efficacy, and improvements in quality of life. The treatment showed a favourable safety profile with effective mitigation of hypoestrogenic effects through add-back therapy. These results sup
