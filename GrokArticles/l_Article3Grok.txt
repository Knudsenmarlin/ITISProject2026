Background
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for approximately half of all heart failure cases and is strongly associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and systemic inflammation. No treatment has yet demonstrated a clear reduction in clinical events in this population. Finerenone, a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, has shown cardiorenal protective effects in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. The FINEARTS-HF trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of finerenone in reducing cardiovascular events among patients with symptomatic heart failure and preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction, irrespective of diabetes status.
Methods
In this international, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial, 6 012 patients with New York Heart Association class II–IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40%, elevated natriuretic peptides, and evidence of structural heart disease were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive finerenone (titrated to 20 mg or 40 mg once daily, according to estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum potassium) or matching placebo, in addition to standard therapy. The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure events (hospitalisations or urgent visits). The trial was designed to detect a 20% relative risk reduction with 90% power. Median follow-up was 32 months.
Results
The primary outcome occurred in 624 patients (20.8 events per 100 patient-years) in the finerenone group and 749 patients (24.9 events per 100 patient-years) in the placebo group (rate ratio 0.84; 95% CI 0.76–0.93; P<0.001). The benefit was consistent across prespecified subgroups, including those with and without diabetes, across ejection fraction strata, and regardless of baseline kidney function. Finerenone significantly reduced total heart failure events (rate ratio 0.82; 95% CI 0.73–0.92) and showed a trend toward lower cardiovascular mortality. Hyperkalaemia occurred more frequently with finerenone (14.2% vs 6.9%; mainly mild to moderate), but rates of severe hyperkalaemia and permanent discontinuation due to hyperkalaemia were low (2.3% vs 0.9%). Acute kidney injury rates were similar between groups.
Conclusions
In patients with heart failure and preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction, finerenone significantly reduced the risk of the composite of cardiovascular death and total heart failure events compared with placebo. These results establish finerenone as an effective therapeutic option for improving outcomes in HFpEF and HFmrEF, with an acceptable safety profile in a broad, high-risk population.
