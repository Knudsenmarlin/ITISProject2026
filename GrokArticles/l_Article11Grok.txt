Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fibrosing interstitial lung disease with high mortality and limited treatment options. Current antifibrotic therapies slow decline in lung function but do not halt disease progression or reverse fibrosis. BI 1015550, an oral phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B) inhibitor, has demonstrated antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects in preclinical models and early clinical studies. The FIBRONEER-ILD trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of BI 1015550 in patients with IPF.
Methods
In this international, phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 993 patients with IPF (diagnosed according to 2018 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines, forced vital capacity [FVC] ≥45% predicted, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ≥25% predicted) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive oral BI 1015550 9 mg twice daily, BI 1015550 18 mg twice daily, or matching placebo for 52 weeks, in addition to background antifibrotic therapy (nintedanib or pirfenidone) or no background therapy. The primary endpoint was the absolute change from baseline in FVC at week 52. Key secondary endpoints included time to first acute exacerbation, progression-free survival (composite of death or ≥10% absolute decline in FVC), change in health-related quality of life (King’s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire), and safety. The primary analysis used a mixed model for repeated measures in the intention-to-treat population.
Results
At week 52, the adjusted mean absolute change in FVC was –98.5 mL (95% CI –139.2 to –57.8) in the BI 1015550 18 mg group, –135.7 mL (–176.4 to –95.0) in the 9 mg group, and –207.6 mL (–248.3 to –166.9) in the placebo group (P<0.0001 for 18 mg vs placebo; P=0.0015 for 9 mg vs placebo), corresponding to a 52.6% and 34.6% relative reduction in FVC decline, respectively. The 18 mg dose significantly prolonged time to first acute exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.51; 95% CI 0.31–0.84; P=0.008) and improved progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.62; 95% CI 0.48–0.80; P<0.001). No significant differences were observed in quality-of-life measures. Adverse events were more frequent with BI 1015550, primarily gastrointestinal (diarrhoea 48% vs 19% with placebo, nausea 32% vs 11%), mostly mild to moderate and transient. Serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events were similar across groups.
Conclusions
In patients with IPF, BI 1015550 at 18 mg twice daily significantly slowed decline in lung function, reduced the risk of acute exacerbations, and delayed disease progression compared with placebo, with an acceptable safety profile. These findings suggest that PDE4B inhibition with BI 1015550 offers clinically meaningful additional benefit in IPF and represents a potential new treatment option.
