Background
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, with no disease-modifying therapies currently approved that substantially slow clinical progression in the symptomatic phase. Lecanemab, a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively targets soluble amyloid-β protofibrils, has shown promise in reducing amyloid pathology and slowing cognitive decline in early Alzheimer’s disease. The CLARITY AD trial was designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods
In this phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 1 795 participants with early Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease or mild Alzheimer’s dementia), confirmed amyloid positivity on positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and Mini-Mental State Examination score of 22–30 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous lecanemab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or matching placebo for 18 months. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to 18 months in the Clinical Dementia Rating–Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score. Key secondary endpoints included changes in the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale–cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog14), Alzheimer’s Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS), and Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study–Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-MCI-ADL). Amyloid burden was assessed by PET. The primary analysis used a mixed model for repeated measures in the modified intention-to-treat population.
Results
At 18 months, lecanemab treatment was associated with a statistically significant slowing of clinical decline on the primary endpoint (adjusted least-squares mean difference in change from baseline in CDR-SB score, –0.45; 95% CI –0.67 to –0.23; P<0.001), representing a 27% reduction in decline compared with placebo. Consistent benefits were observed across all key secondary endpoints, including a 26% reduction in decline on ADAS-cog14 and a 37% reduction on ADCOMS. Lecanemab markedly reduced amyloid PET standardised uptake value ratio (least-squares mean difference –0.71; P<0.001). The most common adverse events with lecanemab were infusion-related reactions (26.4% vs 7.4% with placebo) and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA)–edema (12.6% vs 1.7%), most of which were asymptomatic or mild and occurred predominantly during the first 3 months. Serious ARIA events were rare (0.7% vs 0.2%).
Conclusions
In patients with early Alzheimer’s disease, lecanemab treatment resulted in a modest but highly significant slowing of cognitive and functional decline over 18 months compared with placebo, accompanied by substantial clearance of amyloid pathology. These findings provide evidence that targeting soluble amyloid-β protofibrils with lecanemab offers a disease-modifying effect in early Alzheimer’s disease, with an acceptable safety profile when appropriate monitoring is implemented.
