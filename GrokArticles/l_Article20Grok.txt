Background
Biliary atresia is the leading cause of neonatal cholestasis and the most common indication for paediatric liver transplantation worldwide. Despite Kasai portoenterostomy, most children develop progressive liver fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis. No adjuvant therapy has been proven to improve native liver survival. Odevixibat, an ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor, reduces enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and has shown reductions in serum bile acids and improvements in pruritus and growth in children with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. The BOLD trial assessed the efficacy and safety of odevixibat as adjuvant therapy in infants with biliary atresia following Kasai portoenterostomy.
Methods
In this international, phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 254 infants (aged ≤90 days at Kasai procedure) with biliary atresia were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral odevixibat (target dose 120 µg/kg/day) or matching placebo, initiated within 3 weeks after Kasai portoenterostomy and continued for 104 weeks or until liver transplant, death, or withdrawal. The primary endpoint was time to first occurrence of liver transplant or death (native liver survival). Key secondary endpoints included change in serum total bilirubin at week 26, proportion of patients with total bilirubin ≤1.0 mg/dL at week 52, growth parameters, and safety. The primary analysis used a Cox proportional-hazards model in the intention-to-treat population.
Results
Over 104 weeks, 42.5% of patients in the odevixibat group and 57.5% in the placebo group reached the primary endpoint of liver transplant or death (hazard ratio 0.68; 95% CI 0.49–0.94; P=0.019), corresponding to a 32% relative risk reduction. Median native liver survival time was not reached in the odevixibat group versus 68 weeks in the placebo group. At week 26, odevixibat-treated patients had significantly greater reductions in total bilirubin (least-squares mean difference –1.8 mg/dL; 95% CI –2.5 to –1.1; P<0.0001), and a higher proportion achieved total bilirubin ≤1.0 mg/dL at week 52 (38% vs 16%; P=0.0004). Improvements in weight-for-age z-scores were observed with odevixibat. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea (52% vs 34%) and abdominal pain (28% vs 19%), mostly mild to moderate. Serious adverse events occurred in 41% versus 48% of patients, with no new safety signals.
Conclusions
In infants with biliary atresia post-Kasai portoenterostomy, adjuvant odevixibat significantly improved native liver survival, reduced serum total bilirubin, and supported better growth compared with placebo. These findings establish odevixibat as the first medical therapy to meaningfully delay disease progression and reduce the need for liver transplantation in this high-risk population, with an acceptable safety profile.
