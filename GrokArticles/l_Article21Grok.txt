Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major global health burden, with chronic hepatitis B leading to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality in millions of individuals. Current nucleos(t)ide analogue therapies effectively suppress viral replication but rarely achieve functional cure (sustained loss of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] with or without seroconversion). Bepirovirsen, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting all HBV messenger RNAs, has shown promising reductions in HBsAg and HBV DNA in phase 2 studies. The B-Well-1 and B-Well-2 trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bepirovirsen in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogues in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Methods
In two identically designed, international, phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (B-Well-1: n=814; B-Well-2: n=802), adults with chronic hepatitis B (HBeAg-positive or -negative) on stable nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy for ≥6 months, with HBV DNA <90 IU/mL and HBsAg ≥100 IU/mL, were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive subcutaneous bepirovirsen 300 mg weekly for 24 weeks followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks for 24 weeks, or matching placebo, in addition to continued nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with functional cure, defined as HBsAg loss and HBV DNA <LLOQ for ≥24 weeks off all therapy (assessed at week 48 post-treatment). Key secondary endpoints included durable HBsAg loss, HBeAg loss/seroconversion, and safety. The primary analysis used logistic regression in the intention-to-treat population.
Results
In the pooled analysis at the primary endpoint assessment (week 48 off therapy), functional cure was achieved in 9.8% of participants in the bepirovirsen group versus 0.5% in the placebo group (difference 9.3%; 95% CI 6.8–11.8; P<0.0001). Rates were higher in HBeAg-negative patients (12.1% vs 0.6%) and those with baseline HBsAg ≤3,000 IU/mL (18.4% vs 0.8%). Durable HBsAg loss (through week 48 off therapy) occurred in 10.2% versus 0.5% (P<0.0001). Most responders achieved HBsAg loss during the initial 24-week treatment phase. Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate; the most common treatment-emergent events with bepirovirsen were injection-site reactions (42% vs 8%), alanine aminotransferase flares (28% vs 11%, mostly asymptomatic and associated with response), and fatigue. Serious adverse events occurred in 6.1% versus 4.8%, with no excess of liver decompensation.
Conclusions
In patients with chronic hepatitis B on nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy, bepirovirsen significantly increased the rate of functional cure compared with placebo, with durable off-treatment responses in a clinically meaningful subset of patients. These findings represent a major advance toward achieving functional cure in chronic hepatitis B and support bepirovirsen as a potential transformative therapy in this field.
