Background
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a debilitating condition characterized by recurrent wheals and/or angioedema lasting more than 6 weeks, with substantial impairment of quality of life. Many patients remain symptomatic despite treatment with high-dose second-generation H1-antihistamines and omalizumab. Remibrutinib, an oral, highly selective covalent Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, has shown rapid and sustained inhibition of mast cell activation in phase 2 studies. The REMIX-1 and REMIX-2 trials were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remibrutinib in patients with inadequately controlled CSU.
Methods
In two identically designed, international, phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (REMIX-1: n=463; REMIX-2: n=465), adults with CSU refractory to H1-antihistamines (Weekly Urticaria Activity Score [UAS7] ≥16) were randomly assigned (2:1:1) to receive oral remibrutinib 25 mg twice daily, remibrutinib 100 mg once daily, or matching placebo for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 12 in UAS7 score. Key secondary endpoints included proportion achieving UAS7=0 (complete response), change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), weekly itch severity score, and safety. Patients on stable background H1-antihistamines continued therapy. The primary analysis used a mixed model for repeated measures in the intention-to-treat population.
Results
At week 12, both remibrutinib regimens significantly reduced UAS7 scores compared with placebo (REMIX-1: least-squares mean difference –11.0 [25 mg BID] and –11.5 [100 mg QD] vs placebo, both P<0.0001; REMIX-2: –10.8 and –11.2, both P<0.0001). Complete response (UAS7=0) rates were 45–52% with remibrutinib versus 4–6% with placebo (P<0.0001). Rapid onset of action was observed by week 2, with sustained benefits through week 52. Significant improvements were seen in itch severity and DLQI scores. Adverse events were comparable across groups; the most common treatment-emergent events with remibrutinib were mild transient elevations in liver enzymes (ALT/AST, mostly grade 1–2) and headache. Serious adverse events occurred in <5% of patients across arms, with no increased risk of infections or bleeding events.
Conclusions
In two large phase 3 trials, oral remibrutinib (25 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily) provided rapid, substantial, and durable reductions in disease activity and improvements in quality of life in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria refractory to antihistamines. The efficacy was consistent across both dosing regimens, with a favourable safety profile. These findings support remibrutinib as a promising oral treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe CSU who have inadequate response to standard therapies.
