Background
Advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations represents a distinct molecular subset with poor response to standard EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and limited treatment options beyond chemotherapy. Amivantamab, a fully human bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and MET, has shown activity in this population. The PAPILLON trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of amivantamab plus carboplatin–pemetrexed as first-line therapy compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutated NSCLC.
Methods
In this international, phase 3, randomised, open-label trial, 308 patients with treatment-naïve, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harbouring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations (without prior systemic therapy) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive amivantamab (1050 mg [1400 mg if body weight ≥80 kg] weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks) plus carboplatin and pemetrexed, or carboplatin–pemetrexed alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by blinded independent central review. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, and safety. Crossover from the chemotherapy arm to amivantamab monotherapy was permitted upon progression. The primary analysis used a stratified log-rank test in the intention-to-treat population.
Results
At the prespecified interim analysis (median follow-up 14.9 months), median PFS was 11.4 months (95% CI 9.7–13.7) in the amivantamab–chemotherapy group versus 6.7 months (95% CI 5.6–7.3) in the chemotherapy-alone group (hazard ratio 0.40; 95% CI 0.30–0.53; P<0.001), representing a 60% reduction in risk of progression or death. The benefit was consistent across prespecified subgroups, including by insertion variant and baseline characteristics. ORR was 73% (95% CI 65–80) versus 47% (95% CI 39–55) (P<0.001), with longer median duration of response (10.1 vs 5.6 months). Interim OS showed a trend favouring the combination (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.43–1.05). The most common adverse events with amivantamab–chemotherapy were EGFR-related (rash 86%, paronychia 45%, infusion-related reactions 42%), mostly grade 1–2; grade ≥3 events were primarily haematologic and comparable between groups. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 8% versus 5%.
Conclusions
In patients with treatment-naïve advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, first-line amivantamab plus carboplatin–pemetrexed significantly improved progression-free survival and response rates compared with chemotherapy alone, with a manageable safety profile. These results establish amivantamab plus chemotherapy as a new standard of care for this molecularly defined population.
